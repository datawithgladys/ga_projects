"I'm a former Apple engineer and I build the Apollo Reddit client! Today for my birthday I'm donating 100% of Apollo's proceeds to my SPCA Animal Shelter who really need the help. If you've ever had a passing interest in Apollo (or even already have it, secrets inside) there's no better day! üê∂üê± EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!

Hey r/Apple!

I'm decently active in this community, but for those of you who I haven't said hi to, I'm an iOS app developer, I used to work at Apple and now for the last several years I've built [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575), an awesome Reddit app for iOS that I built with the goal of ""what would it look like if Apple themselves built a Reddit app?"". 

### What's going on today?

Today it's my 27th birthday, and I want to raise a bunch of money for the SPCA Animal Shelter and a bunch of animals that are going through some rough times. Heck, I want to go a step further and break the all-time single day donation record. **So for today, 100% of Apollo's proceeds are going to the SPCA.**

If you buy literally anything in the app like Apollo Pro, I'll donate 100% of the proceeds to the SPCA, so it's a great day if you even have a passing interest in Apollo. If you already have unlocked things in Apollo, boy do I have a treat for you! A lot of people have been asking for an ""animals/pets"" style homescreen icon option for Apollo, and today I released a ""stealth update"" that has an all new SPCA themed icon commissioned by the absolutely incredible [David Lanham](https://dlanham.com/). It's so gorgeous, [I love how it turned out](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png). Not only today, but literally for every day forever, 100% of the proceeds for this will go to the SPCA. You get the icon, some wallpapers, and even an exclusive Apollo Community Pets Photo Album included. There's even another Easter egg if you unlock it. 

If you want to go the direct route instead (or in addition) that would be amazing too! I created a direct fundraiser page: https://www.canadahelps.org/en/pages/apollo-app-2020-spca-fundraiser/ This is doubly awesome if you have an employer who donation-matches to charities. Seriously, I know a lot of people are like ""hurr durr every dollar counts"" but no bullshit, it **really** does here. Think of the size of this community, 1.6 million people. If even a small percentage of them gave a single dollar we could make a massive difference. 

### What's an ""Apollo""? It's a different Reddit app?

If you're happy with the official app and have no idea what Apollo is, that's totally cool. I wasn't really perfectly happy with any of the iOS Reddit app offerings out there (especially with Alien Blue's passing). The official app in particular (while built by some insanely smart people whom I have a ton of respect for) I think tries to toe the line between a single experience across their Android and an iOS apps more than I like, so I really wanted to create an iOS-first Reddit experience that felt at home on iOS, built for speed, power features, and insanely great media consumption. It's free to download and use!

It's kinda like a car, you might be perfectly happy with yours and wonder what's the point of another car, but you might drive in another car and just find it more fun and comfortable to use. On top of this Apollo has some really slick custom gestures, a Jump Bar for quickly bouncing between subreddits, color-coded comments for easy navigation, a really powerful media viewer, Smart Portrait Lock, and it was voted the best Reddit app for iOS by [John Gruber of Daring Fireball](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/08/24/apollo) as well as [The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/apps/the-best-reddit-app-for-ios/), with over 2 million downloads and over 100K 5-star reviews.

### Why right now?

These warm months are dubbed ""[kitten season](https://spca.bc.ca/news/kitten-season/)"" by shelters, because it's the time of the year that all the cats like to give birth. So the shelters get a sudden massive influx of a ton of orphaned and surrendered (and sometime left to die) kittens and it massively drains their resouces like food. This is amplified by the COVID pandemic where a lot less people have been able to gets their pets neutered, and adoptions have lessened due to people staying inside. So it's a really, really hard time of the year and they (and the animals they're helping) are really in need of the help.

They're also special for me because it's where I rescued my two cats. Pet tax photo album: https://imgur.com/a/q9cL7t6

So yeah, if you enjoy my work at all, or like animals at all, or want me to have a good birthday, or just want some happiness in this otherwise crappy year, it would really mean the world to me if you could check out any of the above links and help out the shelter. The donation record for a single day [is $27,355 that we set last year](https://old.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/cg11x7/i_dont_even_know_how_to_title_this_typing_from/), but I really really want to beat it this year! I think with the combination of the new icon, Apollo having more users than ever, and the direct donation option, we can do it.

I'll of course keep you all posted once I find out how much Apollo raised by tomorrow! In the meantime I'd love to hang around and talk if you have any questions or insights or just want to share pet pics haha.

\- Christian

EDIT: Only a few hours left! When this post turns 24 hours old the donations will be totaled! If you're considering Apollo now is the perfect time! 9:30 AM PT is the time mark! Thank you so much everyone!

EDIT: Over! I'm totaling up the donations! Will update shortly!",1

"[Self Promo Saturday] I released a really big update to my Reddit app Apollo for Reddit, featuring a supercharged Media Viewer, Smart Rotation Lock, Portrait Lock Buddy, GIF conversion, Reddit video downloading, Share as Image, new icons, awards, polls, iPad trackpad support, and more! Hey r/Apple, I build a Reddit app for iOS called Apollo, you all have been really nice in the past and provided great feedback when I've posted, so I wanted to update you about a really big update I just released that I've been working on for months: Apollo 1.8! 

I don't want this to be one of those recipe blog posts where you have to scroll through a ten page story to get to the good stuff, so I'll cut right to the point and list the features. I'll hang around the thread for as long as you want to answer questions/suggestions as well!

(I like to do thorough changelogs because it makes me feel good about myself, but if this is tl;dr for you here's a quick feature list blast for the update: **media viewing upgrades, Reddit video downloading, on the fly GIF conversion, faster sharing, Smart Rotation Lock, Portrait Lock Buddy, 5 new app icons, share post/comment as an image, Reddit polls, new Reddit awards, fast comment parent previewing, more iOS 13 context menus, iPad pointer/trackpad support.**)

(Oh and if you view the changelog in Apollo I embedded images for extra clarity.)

### Media Viewer

- I've always really prided in Apollo having a best in class media viewing experience, cleanly supporting Imgur, Gfycat, Reddit, Streamable and more directly inline, and very quickly. This update brings that to the next level, with even better support for videos and GIFs, where they transition elegantly from playing inline in the feed to a really slick experience in the media viewer, with full controls, GIF scrubbing, GIF pausing, mute controls, playback speed, downloading, sharing, and more. 

### Media Sharing

- Save/share as GIF! Long story short, GIFs are an old format, so behind the scenes most sites just store them as MP4 videos with their audio removed, since videos are a more modern, efficient format. This is great, but GIFs are still more compatible everywhere. So I rewrote the engine and now Apollo can convert the video on the fly into a GIF super quickly, so if you want that nice, old school GIF format to share or save, you can have the best of both worlds. I'm gonna open source this engine, it was a lot of fun.
- Download/share Reddit videos! Reddit videos are in a weird format that can make them hard to work with, essentially the audio and video streams are separate, so to download them you normally need like a weird website that'll handle it for you, but Apollo will automatically download and stitch the audio and video together for you now!
- Sharing even normal videos is better too, since Apollo now integrates even better with the Messages app, Apollo adds custom metadata to the video to enable the Messages app to autoplay (muted) and autoloop the videos, so your friends don't have to tap on the video and open the player to make it start playing. 
- Fixes a longstanding bug where when playing music in the background Apollo sometimes wouldn't resume the audio if it interrupted it because you wanted to play a video. Now it'll properly resume your audio and leave you right where you were in your song/podcast.
- Sharing is more streamlined too, now when you long-press on the content it'll jump *directly* into the share sheet allowing you to do what you please with it, without having to do any intermediary steps. If you want the link versus the image itself, you can choose so right from the share sheet. Same with sharing Reddit links, no more confusion about if you're sharing the image the Reddit post is about, or the link to the comments, etc. Just hold down on the post and you get the post, hold down on the image/video/GIF and you get the video. Bam.
- On iOS 13 and later you can use haptic touch to long press on an image/video/GIF to preview it quickly, and even download/save/share directly from there. It uses those fancy new context menus from iOS 13. Kinda reminds me of a supercharged version of the old media preview from Alien Blue.

# Smart Rotation Lock

- Ever wish your Twitter/Reddit/whatever app would only rotate media like videos, but leave everything else like post feeds alone so they're not rotating all over the place when you just want to watch a video? Apollo now supports this, intelligently allowing rotation for the media viewer but blocking it for everything else if you turn on this feature.

# Portrait Lock Buddy

- That above feature is great, but I found a big catch: if you use the iOS ""Portrait Orientation Lock"" (like from Control Center) there's not much the app can do because *all of iOS is locked to portrait*. Portrait Lock Buddy seeks to solve this dilemma by using CoreMotion to manually detect rotation events and offer you the option to rotate the media if you so choose. So you can have portrait everywhere, but still enjoy a good widescreen video, GIF, or image in Apollo landscape style if you want. :)
- If you're more of a visual learner, I made a short 24 second (no audio) YouTube video that shows how Portrait Lock Buddy works: https://youtube.com/watch?v=EK5sDrpS6Sg

# Share Comment/Post as an Image

- Another way of saying this is kinda like ""convert a comment/post to an image"". This one's great for when you want to screenshot a funny comment or post and send it to a friend. Normally you have to screenshot it, then if you want it to look nice you have to crop it to get rid of the extra parts, kind of a hassle. Worse, what if the comment is really long, or there's multiple, you then have to stitch a bunch of photos together like a 17th century tailor.\n\nApollo 1.8 adds Share as Image, with a quick tap it'll generate an image of the comment or post ready to be whisked off to a friend or saved. You can even tell it to include parent comments that it's replying to, or even the main post as well for context, and it'll automatically stitch long comments together into a single image. And it also works for sharing a post, like a weird creepypasta, or even sharing an image post with the title included as a single image! It's really, really convenient.

# Five New App Icons

- Apollo's always been about making Reddit really customizable, and ever since Apple added the ability to change an app's homescreen icon way back in iOS 10.3 Apollo's been all over it. This update brings 5 new icons you can choose from (in addition to the existing dozens). Here's a picture of the new ones with the original/default icon at the start: https://i.imgur.com/mhFJoVu.png

# New Reddit Awards

- Reddit recently updated the award system to evolve from just Silver, Gold, and Platinum, to now offer a ton of different and cool awards you can choose from with some really neat artwork and themes. Apollo now supports both gifting these new awards if you have the coins already on your account, and of course viewing the awards a post or comment has been given.
- Of course, if you're not a fan of awards there's an option to hide them!

# Reddit Polls

- Reddit recently added the ability for posts to have polls which ask a question and let users vote and see the results. Apollo now supports this, showing the poll inline, with the options available, and once you've voted in the poll or the poll concluded, what the results are.

# Comment Parent Previewing

- On iOS 13 and later comments now get a nice context menu when you use haptic touch on them, but beyond just having some nice options it'll now actually show you the parent comment to the comment you selected, which can be really handy when you're deep in a thread and want to see what the comment is replying to without losing your place. 

# iPad Pointer/Trackpad Support

- iOS 13.4 added a ton of awesome functionality around iPads and mouse/trackpad cursor support across the entirety of iOS. Apollo prides itself in being a first class iOS citizen so it now adopts iOS' pointer support super well. If you have one of the new Magic Keyboards, or even a normal trackpad or mouse, Apollo now interacts with your mouse with awesome hover states and interactions across the app, in a way that makes it feel really at home on iOS and so nice to scroll and flick around with. I'm talking full support for gestures too. It also even improves keyboard support!

# Other

- Improved iconography across the app to be a little more refined, nice, up to date, and pretty. :)
- Added a permanent ""Coin Sale"" button in the top right corner of every screen. Just kidding.
- Select Mode is available in more places (calling it ‚ÄúSelect Text‚Äù now just to be more clear) and selects all by default to make it even faster/friendlier.
- Apollo now has enough features that it's moving its payment model to a full-time subscript‚Äî just kidding, all the features above are either free or can be unlocked via ""Apollo Pro"" for a few bucks if you want to support the app's development!
- If anyone's familiar with Sublime Text I did take a note from their book with how the app is completely free with no ads, but once a month now Apollo will show you a little popup about Pro and how it helps a ton with supporting the app's ongoing development. I'm just one guy building Apollo and not everyone even knows about Pro so I thought this would be a nice balance that isn't too annoying, it'll show a little under twelve times a year, and you can close it in 0.6 seconds, so it's a total of 7.2 seconds a year in minor annoyance that you can get rid of just by supporting the app for a few dollaroonies.
- Context menus from iOS 13 are now used extensively across the UI to make Apollo feel even more like the iOS/iPadOS first class citizen it is. :)
- I designed the ""Apollo Pro"" and ""Tip Jar"" screens with some fun treats so you should definitely check those out hehe. Tips from this update are going toward ""replace my aging MacBook"" fund
- Fixed a lot of small bugs and improved performance in some other areas. :)

# I ran out of things to say

Well that's the update folks! I've got lots of great new features planned for the coming months, plus a really awesome, completely revamped from the ground up iPad app, but I'll take a break from those to answer questions or feedback in this thread as long as you want! I'm going to make cinnamon rolls to celebrate the update going out!

"AirPods Pro impressions from NYC: subway noise, coins pocket test, comfort and more I'm in NYC and just picked up my AirPods Pro. I've seen a couple other posts of impressions so I'll try to cover stuff that hasn't already been done to death. Feel free to ask questions.

* **Apple Store:** Hot tip: If you buy them in-store, set them up next to the line of display iPhones. Absolutely hilarious to watch a full line of iPhones pop up the setup box in sync. When you press connect on yours, all the other ones will switch to ""Not your AirPods Pro."" If that's not a ""pro"" experience, I don't know what is lol.
* **General Comfort:** I liked the original AirPods because they felt invisible and was a little worried about these, especially because earbuds like my Jabra Elite Active 65t buds take a little finagling to get them in right and get a seal, and when you do, there's pressure. AirPods Pro really surprised me. The tips feel excellent, *almost* invisible once they're in, and I didn't have to adjust at all to get a good seal. The Ear Tip Test is cool, very quick, and to my surprise confirmed I did get a good seal. That vent makes a massive difference in comfort, holy shit. Also, small note, but they look much nicer in ear than regular AirPods. Stem is way less noticeable.
* **Sound Quality:** If you like the way AirPods sound, you'll like these more because of the seal and reduced outside noise. Bass hits a little harder, you notice a little more detail in songs, etc. If you don't like how AirPods sound, you'll like these a little more but they won't blow you away. It's what you'd expect, nothing crazy. *EDIT: Had more time to test the sound quality. It's actually a bigger step up than I thought previously (I was mostly paying attention to ANC quality). The seal makes a big difference but honestly the drivers are just better.*
* **Subway and Street Noise:** This is the noisiest city I've ever been in. Near the Apple Store there's a lot of construction going on near the subway‚Äîjackhammers, construction workers, huge trucks, just really annoying chaos. I walked to the Apple Store wearing my regular AirPods and it was not fun but it's what I'm used to with them. Walking back to the subway with AirPods Pro cut a *ton* of the noise. I could still hear some of it obviously but suddenly I wasn't annoyed. When I got to the subway, I walked down the steps and saw that the opposite direction train was already there, just started to turn around to see when my train would arrive, and then WHOOSH, it flew by me, arriving. I literally didn't hear it *at all*. That's crazy. All I could hear was Kanye. On the subway itself, I couldn't really hear anybody around me and could barely hear the train. I switched to a podcast and it was like having the people and train at 20% volume. With normal AirPods on the subway I'd listen to podcast at like 80-90% volume; with the Pro I literally turned it *down* to about 50-60%. Amazing. Then on the walk home, I couldn't hear anybody on the street despite seeing people chatting or talking on their phone (on speakerphone of course). It was great.
* **Jeans Coin Pocket Test:** Saw some people worried about this as well. I can confirm that these *do* fit in my jeans coin pocket *better* than the old AirPods. The case for the old ones was more squarish, so I always had to kinda *push* it in a little bit. The Pro case on the other hand is long and narrow so you just turn it to the side and it slips in super easily. [I took a quick video here.](https://imgur.com/CeJwTUm)
* **Negatives:** They're white so the case still picked up lint from my jeans which is annoying but oh well, the controls definitely take a hot minute to get used to, and again, the sound quality isn't gonna blow you away if you didn't already like the way AirPods sound. So far those are my only negatives.

Obviously it hasn't been that long but I was literally grinning while walking home because suddenly NYC wasn't as loud and annoying anymore and I could actually hear my music and hear myself think. I'm super happy with these so far.",1

"PSA: Tip for those experiencing diminished AirPods battery life I have the 1st generation, original AirPods that I've owned since their release (~3 years ago as of writing).  The battery life for each AirPod has been steadily decreasing over time, down to about 1.5 hours of audio-only usage before needing a recharge in their case, which is frustratingly short.

Before throwing them away, I decided to try one last trick.  I completely reset the AirPods case (holding down the white button on the back for 10+ seconds), and re-paired them with my iPhone.  I then completely drained both AirPods down to zero, and the case itself down to zero through normal usage.  Then, I put the dead AirPods into the dead case, and charged them both up to 100%.  

This combination of reset/drain/recharge seems to have re-calibrated the battery life measurement system, and they no longer die at 1.5 hours. I'm now getting double that at around 3 - 3.5 hours, which is great for such an old pair.  Hopefully this helps anybody experiencing this same thing.   Try this battery recalibration!

edit - the AirPods are also draining ""evenly"" now!  Before, one AirPod would drain faster than the other.",1

"[Update on yesterday's Apollo SPCA Fundraiser] We raised $42,749.29 yesterday for the SPCA Animal Shelter. FORTY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. Thank you r/Apple! That's the historic RECORD for SPCA donations in a single day! We made such a difference to these animals, you're amazing. üê∂üê±üê∞ Hey everyone! As promised I wanted to provide an update from [yesterday's Apollo fundraiser post I made here that people seemed to really enjoy](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/huo3vx/im_a_former_apple_engineer_and_i_build_the_apollo/).

Long story short I work full time on making an awesome Reddit app for iOS called [Apollo for Reddit](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) that people ended up really liking and after over 2 million downloads I've been able to make it into my full time job. I love animals and our local SPCA shelter needed money due to an influx of orphaned kittens in these warm months (dubbed ""kitten season""), made worse by the COVID pandemic and a decrease in adoptions and neutering, so the plan was to donate all my proceeds from the app for the day to the SPCA. So anyone who was interested in the Pro unlock in app could get the it AND support a good cause!

Well yesterday blew away my wildest expectations. Seriously. To be clear I don't even make in the planetary orbit of this on a daily basis, the AMA and Apple subreddit post and support around the fundraiser amplifies it to a crazy extent and a lot of people support the app which is incredible and exactly what I want because this kind of amazing thing happens. I think the large amount of money was due to a lot of people meaning to unlock the Pro/Ultra version of Apollo (it's free download/use) but hadn't got around to it yet, plus [a new icon option](https://i.imgur.com/rCm1Sfz.png) giving existing users a fun thing to unlock and support, and Apollo's grown a lot over the last year with even more people enjoying it, so combined with the AMA and the post in r/Apple it had a lot of eyes on the fundraiser. Which I'm so happy and feel so fortunate for.

**We raised a total of $42,749.29. Forty. Two. Thousand. Dollars.** That's a ton of money, that's like multiple cars. Or put another way, this bag of cat food is $5/pound. I'm sure the SPCA can get a better bulk/charity price than that, so let's say $4/pound. **That's over 10,600 pounds of cat food.** Adult great white sharks weigh around 1,250 pounds. That's the weight of over 8 great white sharks in cat food. 

Here's an image breaking down the figures for how the $42,749 came to be. ($39.6K from sales proceeds, $2.5K direct donations, $600 from responses): https://i.imgur.com/qA0Am8F.png

The previous record for donations in a single day to the Nova Scotia SPCA was coincidentally $27,355 [from our fundraiser last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/cg18r3/update_on_yesterdays_apollo_spca_fundraiser_ama/)! I so desperately wanted to beat that this year and we crushed it by over 50%! I'm now in the process of logistically figuring out how to transfer this much money over to them as cheaply as possible without losing much to credit card fees and whatnot, but as evidenced from the [SPCA Twitter account](https://twitter.com/NSSPCA) you can verify that the money will reach them, given their trust in me and the donations we've made in previous years. Speaking of which, the first year we raised $5,087 the first year, $27,355 the second year, and $42,749 this year (third year) which brings us to a lifetime total of $75,099. What a beautiful number to end up on this year, I'm really hoping we can pass $100,000 one day!

Anyway, thank you so much for your support. I'll stick around to answer some more questions if anyone has any (I tried to answer every single one from yesterday), but other than that I'm going to get back to work on Apollo version 1.9 which I'm hoping to have out by the end of the month. If you'd like to check out Apollo I'd really love to know what you think, I crafted it with a ton of care toward really feeling at home as an iOS app, and being super fast and comfortable to use, and I really pride myself in listening to the community to build the best app I can. https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575

Other than that, stay safe!!

"I lost my AirPod Pros while golfing and Find My saved my ass. Plus, I learned a bit about how it works I was golfing with some buddies yesterday and we finished up around 4:30pm. I shot a 91 and took $42 off of them, but I digress. I left the course and got home around 5:15. It was at this point that I realized my AirPod Pros were no longer in my pocket. I frantically searched everywhere in my house and car, but nothing. 

Then, I remembered Find My. I pulled it up and it showed their last location was on the course around 4:11pm, just before we finished. I called the course to see if anyone had turned them in, but they hadn‚Äôt. They took my name and number and said they‚Äôd call me if they turned up. 

It dawned on me that if I looked at the satellite view on the map, I might be able to tell exactly what hole I lost them on. Sure enough, the satellite view showed their last known location in the rough along the 18th hole. 

Knowing it was a long-shot, but not wanting to lose my $250 headphones, I jumped in the car and raced back to the course to try and get there before they closed. I made it with 15 minutes to spare. I told the guy that I‚Äôm the one that called and that I think I might know where they are. He let me use a cart and I raced out to the 18th hole. 

I got to the spot on the map where it said they were last seen, but nothing. I searched around the area for a good ten minutes, but came up empty handed. Then it dawned on me: the AirPods don‚Äôt have GPS, so the location Find My was giving me was the last time the phone had ‚Äúseen‚Äù them (the point where they were no longer connected). This meant that they had to be farther back, closer to the start of the hole. 

I jumped in the cart and headed back about 100 yards and sure enough, sitting up in the grass just off the cart path was the shining white case of my AirPod Pros!

As you can imagine, a huge weight was lifted off my chest and I could finally enjoy the sweet victory of my round!",1

"Got tired of taking low-res screenshots of my 4k videos for sharing. So I made an app to extract full-resolution frames from videos and Live Photos. Simple, free and open source. I shoot many videos and often want to save a cool moment as a photo to my photo library. Or share with friends or post on Instagram. I used to take screenshots but was never happy with them since they are low resolution and don't carry any metadata.

[Basically, I was tired of this](https://i.imgur.com/H1ZbCqR.jpg). So I made [Frame Grabber (App Store Link)](https://apps.apple.com/app/frame-grabber/id1434703541) to extract full-resolution frames from videos and Live Photos. It does its job quickly and is dead-simple to use.

The app is completely free and you don't need to unlock anything. Privacy is important to me so no ads either, no analytics, just app.

If you're interested in the source code, [check it out here](https://github.com/arthurhammer/FrameGrabber). It's my first app and I learned a ton making it! I open-sourced it so other beginners can hopefully learn something from it.

Any feedback about app or code is highly appreciated! :)

"PSA: Face ID is not supposed to unlock the phone if you wear a mask I‚Äôve seen a couple of posts in the /new queue about this and maybe it‚Äôs a good idea to make it clear what the 13.5 update did to Face ID.

Prior to 13.5, when you had the mask on your face, Face ID tried to scan your face normally and, once it failed after approximately 3 seconds, it would present you with the passcode prompt.  When you had the mask on each scan would take at least a couple of extra seconds. Given that the average user unlocks their phone [~30 times a day](https://metro.co.uk/2017/12/07/people-compulsively-unlock-their-phones-4000-times-a-year-for-no-reason-7140027/), and that a delay of three seconds will make users [unwilling to check anything](https://neilpatel.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/loading-time-sml.jpg), this is a bad experience as each unlock may take 5+ seconds.

In 13.5, when you have the mask of your face, Face ID checks for a mask or something that covers the lower regions of your face (I tested a balaklava as well) and then *instantly* offers you to type the passcode. This simply means that the useless 3-second scan is not done, which in turn means that you don‚Äôt waste at least one minute of your day in waiting for your iPhone to finish the useless scan.",1

"Apple watch should have a ""Sick"" mode I'm one of the people who uses the health and activity functions of my Apple watch religiously every day. I'm currently sick with the flu and so I've adjusted my goals down dramatically to what I can actually accomplish. But the watch doesn't know why and it keeps telling me to get moving, which I find annoying and discouraging. But also, I can't help but feel like the watch should be able to actually help me rest and recover. Like, if I could tell the watch that I'm sick, it could replace some of the normal reminders with actually helpful reminders to drink water or avoid too much activity when it senses I'm doing too much. It could also be doing things like helping me keep track of symptoms and medication. It could also put a hiatus on overall goal tracking. Like, I have some 800 days of perfect rings which is a streak I'm not about to give up because I got sick for a few days; the watch should stop counting goals on sick days and let you maintain your streak. This would also have the added benefit of keeping data about illnesses, how often they happen, how long they lasted, etc.

I love the Apple watch so much during normal life, but it tanks hard when you get sick, and if you're committed to getting the benefit out of the watch, getting sick throws the whole thing off, and that sucks.

What do you think? Do you think you'd like a 'sick mode' for the Apple Watch?",1

"[Self Promo Saturday] Today I released version 1.9 of my Apollo for Reddit app, which includes a ton of new features and additions like beautiful crossposting, rich flair controls, comment translation, a new subreddit selector, new app icons, and more! iOS 14 TestFlight beta signup inside too! Hey Apple subreddit,

I'm the developer of Apollo for Reddit, a Reddit app for iOS that the Apple community has been really kind to in the past. I wanted to keep everyone up to date on what I'm doing (not a lot of people seem to know but Apollo is my full-time job!) so I thought I'd make a post showing all the goodies in Apollo version 1.9.

Download link: https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575

In a nutshell, Apollo is a Reddit app built from the ground up to be a first-class app for iOS. I didn't want just another cross-platform hybrid app that feels wonky, but an app built specifically to feel right at home on iOS and take advantage of all of its features. All while being super fast, clean, and very customizable, with a ton of awesome power features like a super-charged media viewer with GIF scrubbing, swipe gestures, slick comments view, smart rotation lock, and so much more. And free to use as long as you want (with the option to support for a few bucks).

My mom also says it's great: https://i.imgur.com/CStrRVr.jpg Plus over 100K 5-star reviews from not my mom!

Oh, and there's a TestFlight signup at the bottom if you want to beta test the app, as well as details on the iOS 14 update to drop when iOS 14 does!

Anyway, without further ado here's the changelog:

## Changelog

Apollo 1.9's a massive update to Apollo that's taken months and months to complete, but I'm really happy with the result, and it brings together a ton of ideas from the community to make Apollo even nicer to use. The update includes a variety of features around crossposts, flair, new app icons, translation, and quality of life improvements. Thanks to everyone who writes in via email or via the [ApolloApp subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/apolloapp), your suggestions for what you want to see in Apollo help immensely and really motivate me to keep making Apollo better and better.

Without further ado, here are the changes included in this 1.9 update to Apollo:

### Crosspost Viewing

Crossposting (taking an existing post and reposting it to a similar subreddit) has been a big part of Reddit for ages, but recently it became a full-fledged feature where you can see exactly which subreddit it came from, and quickly jump to the original post. Apollo now supports this fully, so you can see the interesting content of the post, but also quickly jump over to read the original discussion! Often it's like getting two interesting discussions in one!

### Crossposting

Similar to being able to view crossposts, you can also easily perform a crosspost if you want as well! Simply select the post you want to crosspost, write a title, select the subreddit to crosspost it to, and bam, you're off to the races.

### Image Flair

Flair is a little ‚Äútag‚Äù users can add to their usernames in subreddit, and some subreddits even allow small images/icons to be added in addition to text, like the icon for your favorite sports team, or a character from your favorite TV show. Apollo now shows these beautifully!

### Setting Your Flair

In addition to being able to view the flair as discussed in the previous item, you can now set your own flair! Simply go to the subreddit of your choosing, and you can choose from a list of customizable flairs so you can add a little personality to your comments, showing which language you‚Äôre learning, your username in a video game the subreddit is about, your fitness goals, etc.

### View Long Flair

Some users set loooong flair, and as a result it can get off, which can be annoying when you‚Äôre trying to figure out what it says. Well be annoyed no longer, for you can simply tap on the long flair to bring up a window that expands it fully!

### Find Posts with Same Flair

If the subreddit lets users tag their posts with individual flairs (say, being able to tag whether your question is about a certain character, or a certain topic), you can now simply tap on that flair and Apollo will show you all the other posts in the subreddit that have been tagged with that same flair.
    
### 5 (Yeah, Five!) New App Icons!

This update has taken a ton of time to work on, and as a result I was slightly behind in including the Ultra icons I wanted to include, but as a result there's now a proper Icon Bonanza, with five new icons being included in this update. The first three are Ultra icons, all made by the same incredibly talented designer, Matthew Skiles, who I‚Äôve been a fan of for a long time. I love how these turned out, we have our beloved Apollo mascot reimagined as an angel, a devil, as well as a zany pilot, all in gorgeous, colorful iconography. But those three icons aren't all! Next up, we have a beautiful new Apollo icon representing the trans pride flag (originally created by Monica Helms), which came out really awesome and is a great addition. And last but not least, our incredible community designer, FutureIncident, makes his second appearance with the Japanese-inspired Apollo-san icon! I love this set of icons so much, it‚Äôs going to be really hard to choose.

### Easy Language Translation

Reddit is home to a diverse set of communities that have a variety of fascinating conversations, but sometimes it‚Äôs tricky to understand what‚Äôs being said if the conversation is in a language you‚Äôre not familiar with. Heck, you might even have no idea what the language is! Now Apollo will be able to detect if the language of a comment or post is different than the language of your iOS device, and if so, offer to quickly translate it so you can understand the conversation! It is so handy, whether you‚Äôre following a fascinating conversation or even trying to learn a new language.

### Fast Subreddit Selector

Whether you‚Äôre trying to add a single subreddit to a filter, or adding multiple subreddits at a time to a multireddit, Apollo is now even faster at doing these tasks, with an auto-completing window that makes it super fast to search and add subreddits.

### Total Collapsed Comments &amp; Remembering Collapsed Comments

Two handy new additions to collapsing comments in Apollo. The first, Apollo will show you at a glance how many comments are in the collapsed conversation, which can be super handy for viewing a comment thread. The second thing, if you collapse a bunch of comments, and then come back to that same comment section later, Apollo will now remember which comments you had collapsed, and keep them collapsed for you!

### New Settings, Filters Tweaks, Bug Fixes, and More!

A bunch of awesome new settings have been added to Apollo, like being able to disable the auto-looping of videos with audio, or being able to make it so translation options always show up. Filtering is also even more powerful, with your filters being able to target flair and links as well (in addition to the title), and fixes a few filtering bugs. Apollo also now shows videos from Reddit‚Äôs experimental 'RPAN' service, which is essentially a kind of live stream post that you can now view within Apollo. Of course there's a bunch of other small bug fixes around Apollo, from the occasional account accidentally signing out, to video bugs, to Apollo quitting in the background when it shouldn‚Äôt, as well as a bunch of other small tweaks across the app to improve your quality of life while browsing!

### Known Issues

(To be fixed very shortly. Please let me know if you're on the iOS beta or a stable version because a lot of the issues are understandably only present on the iOS beta, but a fix for those will be out soon as well when iOS 14 drops)

- In weird cicrcumstances you can get duplicated audio
- When rotating device it can sometimes throw you up the feed
- Some accounts with a lot of data can have a bit of lag when returning from background (if this happens to you please send me your logs, Settings tab &gt; About &gt; Logs)

## TestFlight and iOS 14 Beta

I've been working hard at an iOS 14 update with widgets, picture in picture video, a new photo picker, and much more, so if you're interested in beta testing that and providing your feedback/bugs, that would be awesome! You can sign up here: https://testflight.apple.com/join/I6svnXDz

Also note that for this 1.9 update I'm testing a ""phased release"" feature in App Store Connect so it may take a few days to get out to everyone, but the TestFlight beta has it immediately if you're willing to endure some testing and providing feedback as well. :)

If you have any ideas about future updates, suggestions, or just general questions I'm happy to answer as well. It sounds bullshitty but I genuinely do build Apollo with the community in mind and giving people the Reddit app of their dreams.

"Everything you need to know about Spatial Audio I'm a huge AV nerd and I borrowed a pair of AirPods Pro from a friend to test out the Spatial Audio feature, and I see there's a lot of ambiguity regarding this feature and a lot of misinformation and these are my findings after thorough testing:

Firstly, the technology behind this is fascinating. It uses math and HRTFs to map audio frequencies as if they were around you, along with the extra mile Apple goes to have dynamic data by tracking your head movement through the sensors on the AirPods.

Secondly, content support:
Right now it‚Äôs super limited, only Apple TV content mixed in 7.1 and 5.1 or Dolby Atmos works.

What iOS looks for is atleast a 5.1 track output, in Dolby Digital or Digital+ to trigger the Spatial Audio feature hence, AAC won't work, and music won‚Äôt work by default. 

And the only apps which output 5.1 audio are AppleTV and Disney+
You can try Tidal if it‚Äôs available in your country since that supports Dolby Atmos music, I tried listening to some Shawn Mendes and Ariana Grande on my OnePlus device when I had a subscription but it sounded terrible, music doesn‚Äôt work that well with any virtual surround sound tech.

Secondly if you want to watch locally downloaded content, you need to play it back through the built-in QuickTime Player, Infuse doesn‚Äôt support Spatial audio yet, and those files need to be 5.1, AC3 in an mp4 container. I have custom converted and muxed some trailers and i'll try linking those below. Just download and Save to Files app and you'll be golden.

If you are willing to shell out money on Apple TV rentals, try out Gravity and Mission Impossible Rogue Nation, excellent Atmos mixes with great overhead activity.

In Gravity, around the 42 minute mark, the alarm sound has a great overhead effect.
In M:I-5, around the 50 minute mark, the helicopter blades also provide an excellent spatial effect.

Also PSA: Do not download or try out ‚Äú3D Audio‚Äù or Dolby Atmos sample videos on YouTube, they're mixed and exported as binaural audio, and will work on any pairs of headphones. The specialty of Spatial Audio is that it converts normal 5.1 and 7.1 tracks to Binaural Audio on the fly.

That‚Äôs it, Reddit is the only place where I can talk about niche things, hopefully somebody cares lol

"‚ÄúFind My‚Äù is useless when it comes to AirPods. Several weeks ago I woke up and realized I couldn‚Äôt find my AirPods. I looked everywhere in my home and finally pulled up the ‚ÄúFind My‚Äù app to see where I last had them. It said it‚Äôs last known location was right outside of my office the day before. Just as I left to go home.

So I drove to work and looked everywhere outside. Couldn‚Äôt find it. Checked the lost and found of a couple of businesses nearby and nobody had returned it. Did some research online and discovered that if someone were to find them and pair it with their own phone that was it. I would no longer be able to track them. So I accepted that they were gone and now belonged to someone else. And since this happened way before Christmas, I just hoped that they went to someone who worked hard, provided, was a good person and couldn‚Äôt afford something nice like that for themselves. That‚Äôs how I made peace with it. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I‚Äôve been using old, cheap blutooth headphones that I already had. The pairing was terrible. Would randomly disconnect. I was miserable. For weeks now, every time I walked up to my office complex I would look around on the ground just hoping I would find my AirPods just sitting where ‚Äúfind my‚Äù last saw them. But yesterday while I was helping my baby daughters clean their room, I noticed something. There behind their bed lamp were my goddamn AIRPODS! They had taken my AirPods and were pretending they were a magical good luck charm. They had been at my house the entire time. Miles where ‚Äúfind my‚Äù had indicated they were. Never pinged even though I was close to them. Fully charged. 

I attached one of my leftover TILE tags to them. Hopefully that‚Äôs good enough. But never rely on ‚Äúfind my‚Äù to locate your misplaced AirPods. It will only let you down.",1

"I'm building Soosee, an app made in SwiftUI that scans food labels and uses AR to highlight ingredients related to allergies, non-vegan, environmentally unfriendly, keto diet and more. Please help me improve it! Hi all! My ex girlfriend was allergic to oranges. Every time I went to get groceries for her I would have to check the ingredient list to check for oranges or derivatives.

When Corona started I was stuck home for a few weeks so I decided to build an app that quickly scans the ingredient list for words that you're allergic to. While I'm fortunately not allergic to anything, it's already been useful for me when doing groceries for a friend of mine who is lactose intolerant. And because the Soosee (pronounced zoo-sea) can scan in different languages it's also useful for when you're on vacation!

You can see it in action [here](https://jordibruin.github.io/food-scanner/assets/videos/preview-2105.mp4).

With the help of more than 15 people from all over the world, the app is now translated into more than 12 languages from Lithuanian to Chinese to Hungarian to Italian. With more being worked on as I type this. The word lists for the most common allergies are translated to 20 languages.

Besides allergies and vegan products I'm working on adding support for ingredients that have an impact on the environment such as palm oil üå¥, ingredients related to religions such as halal, as well as diets and cosmetics.

I'm hoping to get some feedback from people on if this would be useful and how I could improve the app more. You can find some more info at [www.soosee.app](https://www.soosee.app/). Please sent me some honest feedback, open to hearing anything critical üôÇ

[Join the Testflight here](https://forms.gle/aua4JioJeCmLisd56)

**edit:** Wow, blown away by the response! I'm fixing a tiny annoying bug that someone just reported but I'll answer every single one of you! Leave your email [here](https://forms.gle/aua4JioJeCmLisd56) and I'll send you the invite, it's getting a bit much to respond to every one haha! (first world problem I know üôÇ )

If you say, ""Hey Siri, I just"", Siri responds with, ""I don't know what you mean by, 'Hey Siri, I just'"". Siri then hears itself saying ""Hey Siri, I just"" and responds again with the same message, forever, until you press the button to stop it.

Kind of neat.

"An open letter to Apple customers from an Apple Support employee I created a throwaway to post this because although my anxiety has been high for months, I generally enjoy and need my job. 

I‚Äôve worked for Apple Support for a number of years. I‚Äôve been on the other side of the phone and chat when you‚Äôve contacted Apple for assistance with your device. Most people I talk too are sincerely pleasant and we‚Äôre able to work together to identify and solve their issues. We may not always reach that resolution quickly, but we do generally either resolve or put the necessary steps in order to resolve the issue. 

COVID has been tough for everyone, and although Apple retail stores have closed, Apple support has been open without fail to provide assistance for that computer you haven‚Äôt used since 2007 that you now need to download Zoom on to be able to work from home, among other things. Volumes have been high and I haven‚Äôt missed work, even though my family and home life have been impacted just like everyone else‚Äôs. I‚Äôve been the one to apologize for the long wait times as you hold for us, the one to work to find a resolution since we can‚Äôt get you in a store right now, the one that takes the abuse because you‚Äôre angry that your watch is taking to long to update and just need someone to yell at. And at the end of each day, I log out of work and try not to let the stress of the day bleed into my home life.   My husband is a bar tender and has been out of work since the beginning of COVID and my son has had to complete middle school from home in isolation, they don‚Äôt need the added stress of hearing about my day. 

Which brings me to the reason for this post. You see, I‚Äôm not stressed by the workload. I‚Äôm not stressed because of the angry, sad, frustrated, you name it, people that I work with every day. I‚Äôm not stressed about the long wait times, the ever changing procedures, the fact that stores are closed. No. I‚Äôm stressed about your surveys. 

If you‚Äôve contacted us before, you‚Äôre probably familiar with that quick little survey you get asking you to rate your service. You probably don‚Äôt spend a lot of time on it and don‚Äôt even think it really matters. You‚Äôre wrong. That survey is tied to every single person you‚Äôve talked to about your situation and directly impacts their job. I live in constant fear of being fired because although you left a comment that the service was great, you‚Äôre ultimately unsatisfied because I couldn‚Äôt give you something for free ~ because I don‚Äôt have that ability.  I may have only spoken to you to transfer you the right department, but that survey you left about being angry that YOU couldn‚Äôt change your password to your own Apple ID because you can‚Äôt verify your identity, that survey could be enough to get me talked to, written up or fired. 

Apple takes customer feedback very, very seriously. And so do I. And I don‚Äôt mind feedback when I‚Äôm genuinely in the wrong and get called out, I consider that a learning opportunity. But so many of you leave scathing feedback because you‚Äôre unhappy about something absolutely beyond my control. Many times, it‚Äôs about your Apple account, which we have no access to at all. Do you not understand that due to our high levels of privacy and security, we have absolutely NO access to reset your passwords or change any of your account information? Maybe you don‚Äôt understand that there is a real person behind that call or chat who genuinely wants to help you in most cases. I get it that not all Apple Support advisors are perfect and that you may have had a bad experience once, but I assure you that isn‚Äôt the norm or the majority. My coworkers and I work really, really hard to fix your issues and to make sure you‚Äôre happy with the outcome. 

I run the risk of being written up for getting just 1 bad survey a month, and since COVID started, I‚Äôve gotten more than that believe me.  But I‚Äôm not a bitter employee whining about you guys, I‚Äôm really not. Not 1 of these surveys have been because I did something wrong or gave bad information in the last 3 months. Not one. Instead, I‚Äôve gotten them because the hold time was high, or because you want me to replace an out of warranty iPad 2 with a brand new iPad Pro for free, or you want me to change your password for an Apple ID for you because you can‚Äôt verify your own security questions or access your own email. 

I love my job. I generally love my customers. I‚Äôm only taking the time to write this because I just want people to remember to be kind and understand that I will bend over backwards to help you when you reach out to Apple support.  Things have been tough all around, and I will absolutely do my best to help you when and if I can. For the most part, I work with pretty amazing people every day. And for those of you that exhibit patience even when you‚Äôre frustrated, I appreciate you and will work hard to make sure you‚Äôre happy at the end of our conversation. 

I hope that‚Äôs what you remember when you get that little survey. 

TL,DR:  Apple surveys matter to everyone

Edit/Update:
I thought about this post for a long time before I added it. I analyzed my words to ensure I was conveying things appropriately. I realize after reading some of your comments and with the benefit of hindsight that my intent may not have exactly matched my words. So I‚Äôd like to reiterate that I love my job, and I love the customers I work with. I genuinely didn‚Äôt mean to come across as a complainer or someone who is whining about the work I do. I love Apple and the whole Apple philosophy. I guess the take away that I‚Äôd intended was that your feedback not only matters, but also directly impacts the people that you work with, in both positive and negative ways. I have also provided feedback through internal channels for those who have inquired, and I appreciate those of you that have taken the time to respond.",1

"The Next Processor Change is Within ARMs Reach As you may have seen, I sent the following Tweet: ‚ÄúThe Apple ARM MacBook future is coming, maybe sooner than people expect‚Äù [https://twitter.com/choco\_bit/status/1266200305009676289?s=20](https://twitter.com/choco_bit/status/1266200305009676289?s=20)

Today, I would like to further elaborate on that.

*tl;dr*  
*Apple will be moving to Arm based macs in what I believe are 4 stages, starting around 2015 and ending around 2023-2025: Release of T1 chip Macbooks, release of T2 chip Macbooks, Release of at least one lower end model Arm Macbook, and transitioning full lineup to Arm. Reasons for each are below.*

Apple is very likely going to switch to switch their CPU platform to their in-house silicon designs with an ARM architecture. This understanding is a fairly common amongst various Apple insiders. Here is my personal take on how this switch will happen and be presented to the consumer.

The first question would likely be ‚ÄúWhy would Apple do this again?‚Äù. Throughout their history, Apple has already made two other storied CPU architecture switches - first from the Motorola 68k to PowerPC in the early 90s, then from PowerPC to Intel in the mid 2000s. Why make yet another? Here are the leading reasons:

* Intel  has, in recent years, been making significant losses both in reputation and in actual product value, as well as velocity of product development, breaking their bi-yearly ‚ÄúTick Tock‚Äù cycle for the first time in decades. Most recently, they have fallen well behind AMD‚Äôs processor lines in cost to performance ratio, CPU core count, core design (monolithic design vs ‚Äúchiplet‚Äù), power consumption to performance, silicon supply (Intel with significant manufacturing process and yield issues), and on-silicon security features. While Intel still wins out in certain enterprise and datacenter applications, as well as having a much better reputation for reliability and QA (AMD having shipped numerous chips with a broken random- number generator that prevented even booting some mainstream operating system), the number of such applications slowly dwindles with each new release from AMD, and as confidence among decisionmakers in enterprise increases. In the public consciousness, Intel is quickly becoming a point of ridicule against Apple‚Äôs Mac lineup, rather than a badge of honor.
* By moving to their own designs, Apple will be free from Intel‚Äôs release schedule, which have recently been unpredictable and faced with routine delays due to poor manufacturing yields. Apple will be able to update their Mac lineup on their own timeline, rather than being forced to delay products based on Intel‚Äôs ability to meet the release window. This also allows them to leverage relationships with other silicon fabricators to source chips, rather than relying on Intel ‚Äôs continued ‚Äúiteration‚Äù that‚Äôs leading to a ‚Äú14nm++++++++++‚Äù process, or the continued lack of product diversity with the 10nm process. Apple will also be free to innovate in the design of the silicon platform, rather than being limited by Intel‚Äôs design choices. By having full control of the manufacturing and development cycle, Apple can bring even more in-house optimization to the macOS, as they have been for iOS and iPadOS over the years.
* Using an ARM architecture on the Macs allows for a more unified Apple ecosystem, rather than having separate Mac and iOS-based products. The only distinction will be the device form factor and performance characteristics.
* The x86\_64 architecture is very old and inefficient, using older methodologies for processor design (CISC vs ARM‚Äôs RISC), and the instruction set continues to require support in silicon for emulating 1980s-vintage 16-bit modes, as well as ineffectual and archaic memory addressing modes (segmentation, etc.) The x86\_64 architecture is like a city, built atop a much older city, built atop a yet older city, but every layer is built with NYC infrastructure levels of complexity that suited its time and no further.
* Over the last 10 years, Apple has shown that they can consistently produce impressive silicon designs, often leading the market in performance and capability, and Apple has been aggressively acquiring silicon design talent.

A common refrain heard on the Internet is the suggestion that Apple should switch to using CPUs made by AMD, and while this has been considered internally, it will most likely not be chosen as the path forward, even for their megalithic giants like the Mac Pro. Even though AMD would mitigate Intel‚Äôs current set of problems, it does nothing to help the issue of the x86\_64 architecture‚Äôs problems and inefficiencies, on top of jumping to a platform that doesn‚Äôt have a decade of proven support behind it. Why spend a lot of effort re-designing and re- optimizing for AMD‚Äôs platform when you can just put that effort into your own, and continue the vertical integration Apple is well-known for?

I believe that the internal development for the ARM transition started around 2015/2016 and is considered to be happening in 4 distinct stages. These are not all information from Apple insiders; some of these these are my own interpretation based off of information gathered from supply-chain sources, examination of MacBook schematics, and other indicators from Apple.

# Stage1 (from 2014/2015 to 2017):

The rollout of computers with Apple‚Äôs T1 chip as a coprocessor. This chip is very similar to Apple‚Äôs T8002 chip design, which was used for the Apple Watch Series 1 and Series 2. The T1 is primarily present on the first TouchID enabled Macs, 2016 and 2017 model year MacBook Pros.

Considering the amount of time required to design and validate a processor, this stage most likely started around 2014 or 2015, with early experimentation to see whether an entirely new chip design would be required, or if would be sufficient to repurpose something in the existing lineup. As we can see, the general purpose ARM processors aren‚Äôt a one- trick pony.

To get a sense of the decision making at the time, let‚Äôs look back a bit. The year is 2016, and we're witnessing the beginning of stagnation of Intel processor lineup. There is not a lot to look forward to other than another ‚Äú+‚Äù being added to the 14nm fabrication process. The MacBook Pro has used the same design for many years now, and its age is starting to show. Moving to AMD is still very questionable, as they‚Äôve historically not been able to match Intel‚Äôs performance or functionality, especially at the high end, and since the ‚ÄúRyzen‚Äù lineup is still unreleased, there is absolutely no benchmarks or other data to show they are worth consideration, and AMD‚Äôs most recent line of ‚ÄúBulldozer‚Äù processors were very poorly received. Now is probably as good a time as any to begin experimenting with the in-house ARM designs, but it‚Äôs not time to dive into the deep end yet, our chips are not nearly mature enough to compete, and it‚Äôs not yet certain how long Intel will be stuck in the mud. As well, it is widely understood that Apple and Intel have an exclusivity contract in exchange for advantageous pricing. Any transition would take considerable time and effort, and since there are no current viable alternative to Intel, the in-house chips will need to advance further, and breaching a contract with Intel is too great a risk. So it makes sense to start with small deployments, to extend the timeline, stretch out to the end of the contract, and eventually release a real banger of a Mac.

Thus, the 2016 Touch Bar MacBooks were born, alongside the T1 chip mentioned earlier. There are good reasons for abandoning the piece of hardware previously used for a similar purpose, the SMC or System Management Controller. I suspect that the biggest reason was to allow early analysis of the challenges that would be faced migrating Mac built- in peripherals and IO to an ARM-based controller, as well as exploring the manufacturing, power, and performance results of using the chips across a broad deployment, and analyzing any early failure data, then using this to patch any issues, enhance processes, and inform future designs looking towards the 2nd stage.

The former SMC duties now moved to T1 includes things like

* Fan speed, voltage, amperage and thermal sensor feedback data
* FaceTime camera and microphone IO
* PMIC (Power Management Controller)
* Direct communication to NAND (solid state storage)
* Direct communication with the Touch Bar
* Secure Enclave for TouchID

The T1 chip also communicates with a number of other controllers to manage a MacBook‚Äôs behavior. Even though it‚Äôs not a very powerful CPU by modern standards, it‚Äôs already responsible for a large chunk of the machine‚Äôs operation. Moving control of these peripherals to the T1 chip also brought about the creation of the fabled BridgeOS software, a shrunken-down watchOS-based system that operates fully independently of macOS and the primary Intel processor.

BridgeOS is the first step for Apple‚Äôs engineering teams to begin migrating underlying systems and services to integrate with the ARM processor via BridgeOS, and it allowed internal teams to more easily and safely develop and issue firmware updates. Since BridgeOS is based on a standard and now well-known system, it means that they can leverage existing engineering expertise to flesh out the T1‚Äôs development, rather than relying on the more arcane and specialized SMC system, which operates completely differently and requires highly specific knowledge to work with. It also allows reuse of the same fabrication pipeline used for Apple Watch processors, and eliminated the need to have yet another IC design for the SMC, coming from a separate source, to save a bit on cost.

Also during this time, on the software side, ‚ÄúProject Marzipan‚Äù, today Catalyst, came into existence. We'll get to this shortly.

For the most part, this Stage 1 went without any major issues. There were a few firmware problems at first during the product launch, but they were quickly solved with software updates. Now that engineering teams have had experience building for, manufacturing, and shipping the T1 systems, Stage 2 would begin.

# Stage2 (2018-Present):

Stage 2 encompasses the rollout of Macs with the T2 coprocessor, replacing the T1. This includes a much wider lineup, including MacBook Pro with Touch Bar, starting with 2018 models, MacBook Air starting with 2018 models, the iMac Pro, the 2019 Mac Pro, as well as Mac Mini starting in 2018.

With this iteration, the more powerful T8012 processor design was used, which is a further revision of the T8010 design that powers the A10 series processors used in the iPhone 7. This change provided a significant increase in computational ability and brought about the integration of even more devices into T2. In addition to the T1‚Äôs existing responsibilities, T2 now controls:

* Full audio subsystem
* Secure Enclave for internal NAND storage and encryption/decryption offload
* Management of the whole system‚Äôs power and startup sequence, allowing for trusted boot (ensure boot chain-of-trust with no malicious code/rootkit/bootkit)

Those last 2 points are crucial for Stage 2. Under this new paradigm, the vast majority of the Mac is now under the control of an in-house ARM processor. Stage 2 also brings iPhone-grade hardware security to the Mac. These T2 models also incorporated a supported DFU (Device Firmware Update, more commonly ‚Äúrecovery mode‚Äù), which acts similarly to the iPhone DFU mode and allows restoration of the BridgeOS firmware in the event of corruption (most commonly due to user-triggered power interruption during flashing).

Putting more responsibility onto the T2 again allows for Apple‚Äôs engineering teams to do more early failure analysis on hardware and software, monitor stability of these machines, experiment further with large-scale production and deployment of this ARM platform, as well as continue to enhance the silicon for Stage 3.

A few new user-visible features were added as well in this stage, such as support for the passive ‚ÄúHey Siri‚Äù trigger, and offloading image and video transcoding to the T2 chip, which frees up the main Intel processor for other applications. BridgeOS was bumped to 2.0 to support all of these changes and the new chip.

On the macOS software side, what was internally known as Project Marzipan was first demonstrated to the public. Though it was originally discovered around 2017, and most likely began development and testing within later parts of Stage 1, its effects could be seen in 2018 with the release of iPhone apps, now running on the Mac using the iOS SDKs: Voice Recorder, Apple News, Home, Stocks, and more, with an official announcement and public release at WWDC in 2019. Catalyst would come to be the name of Marzipan used publicly. This SDK release allows app developers to easily port iOS apps to run on macOS, with minimal or no code changes, and without needing to develop separate versions for each. The end goal is to allow developers to submit a single version of an app, and allow it to work seamlessly on all Apple platforms, from Watch to Mac. At present, iOS and iPadOS apps are compiled for the full gamut of ARM instruction sets used on those devices, while macOS apps are compiled for x86\_64. The logical next step is to cross this bridge, and unify the instruction sets.

With this T2 release, the new products using it have not been quite as well received as with the T1. Many users have noticed how this change contributes further towards machines with limited to no repair options outside of Apple‚Äôs repair organization, as well as some general issues with bugs in the T2.

Products with the T2 also no longer have the ‚ÄúLifeboat‚Äù connector, which was previously present on 2016 and 2017 model Touch Bar MacBook Pro. This connector allowed a certified technician to plug in a device called a CDM Tool (Customer Data Migration Tool) to recover data off of a machine that was not functional. The removal of this connector limits the options for data recovery in the event of a problem, and Apple has never offered any data recovery service, meaning that a irreparable failure of the T2 chip or the primary board would result in complete data loss, in part due to the strong encryption provided by the T2 chip (even if the data got off, the encryption keys were lost with the T2 chip). The T2 also brought about the linkage of component serial numbers of certain internal components, such as the solid state storage, display, and trackpad, among other components. In fact, many other controllers on the logic board are now also paired to the T2, such as the WiFi and Bluetooth controller, the PMIC (Power Management Controller), and several other components. This is the exact same system used on newer iPhone models and is quite familiar to technicians who repair iPhone logic boards. While these changes are fantastic for device security and corporate and enterprise users, allowing for a very high degree of assurance that devices will refuse to boot if tampered with in any way - even from storied supply chain attacks, or other malfeasance that can be done with physical access to a machine - it has created difficulty with consumers who more often lack the expertise or awareness to keep critical data backed up, as well as the funds to perform the necessary repairs from authorized repair providers. Other issues reported that are suspected to be related to T2 are audio ‚Äúcracking‚Äù or distortion on the internal speakers, and the BridgeOS becoming corrupt following a firmware update resulting in a machine that can‚Äôt boot.

I believe these hiccups will be properly addressed once macOS is fully integrated with the ARM platform. This stage of the Mac is more like a chimera of an iPhone and an Intel based computer. Technically, it does have all of the parts of an iPhone present within it, cellular radio aside, and I suspect this fusion is why these issues exist.

Recently, security researchers discovered an underlying security problem present within the Boot ROM code of the T1 and T2 chip. Due to being the same fundamental platform as earlier Apple Watch and iPhone processors, they are vulnerable to the ‚Äúcheckm8‚Äù exploit (CVE-2019-8900). Because of how these chips operate in a Mac, firmware modifications caused by use of the exploit will persist through OS reinstallation and machine restarts. Both the T1 and T2 chips are always on and running, though potentially in a heavily reduced power usage state, meaning the only way to clean an exploited machine is to reflash the chip, triggering a restart, or to fully exhaust or physically disconnect the battery to flush its memory. Fortunately, this exploit cannot be done remotely and requires physical access to the Mac for an extended duration, as well as a second Mac to perform the change, so the majority of users are relatively safe. As well, with a very limited execution environment and access to the primary system only through a ‚Äúmailbox‚Äù protocol, the utility of exploiting these chips is extremely limited. At present, there is no known malware that has used this exploit. The proper fix will come with the next hardware revision, and is considered a low priority due to the lack of practical usage of running malicious code on the coprocessor.

At the time of writing, all current Apple computers have a T2 chip present, with the exception of the 2019 iMac lineup. This will change very soon with the expected release of the 2020 iMac lineup at WWDC, which will incorporate a T2 coprocessor as well.

Note: from here on, this turns entirely into speculation based on info gathered from a variety of disparate sources.

Right now, we are in the final steps of Stage 2. There are strong signs that an a MacBook (12‚Äù) with an ARM main processor will be announced this year at WWDC (‚ÄúOne more thing...‚Äù), at a Fall 2020 event, Q1 2021 event, or WWDC 2021. Based on the lack of a more concrete answer, WWDC2020 will likely not see it, but I am open to being wrong here.

# Stage3 (Present/2021 - 2022/2023):

Stage 3 involves the first version of at least one fully ARM-powered Mac into Apple‚Äôs computer lineup.

I expect this will come in the form of the previously-retired 12‚Äù MacBook. There are rumors that Apple is still working internally to perfect the infamous Butterfly keyboard, and there are also signs that Apple is developing an A14x based processors with 8-12 cores designed specifically for use as the primary processor in a Mac. It makes sense that this model could see the return of the Butterfly keyboard, considering how thin and light it is intended to be, and using an A14x processor would make it will be a very capable, very portable machine, and should give customers a good taste of what is to come.

Personally, I am excited to test the new 12"" ‚ÄúARMbook‚Äù. I do miss my own original 12"", even with all the CPU failure issues those older models had. It was a lovely form factor for me.

It's still not entirely known whether the physical design of these will change from the retired version, exactly how many cores it will have, the port configuration, etc. I have also heard rumors about the 12‚Äù model possibly supporting 5G cellular connectivity natively thanks to the A14 series processor. All of this will most likely be confirmed soon enough.

This 12‚Äù model will be the perfect stepping stone for stage 3, since Apple‚Äôs ARM processors are not yet a full-on replacement for Intel‚Äôs full processor lineup, especially at the high end, in products such as the upcoming 2020 iMac, iMac Pro, 16‚Äù MacBook Pro, and the 2019 Mac Pro.

Performance of Apple‚Äôs ARM platform compared to Intel has been a big point of contention over the last couple years, primarily due to the lack of data representative of real-world desktop usage scenarios. The iPad Pro and other models with Apple‚Äôs highest-end silicon still lack the ability to execute a lot of high end professional applications, so data about anything more than video editing and photo editing tasks benchmarks quickly becomes meaningless. While there are completely synthetic benchmarks like Geekbench, Antutu, and others, to try and bridge the gap, they are very far from being accurate or representative of the real real world performance in many instances. Even though the Apple ARM processors are incredibly powerful, and I do give constant praise to their silicon design teams, there still just isn‚Äôt enough data to show how they will perform for real-world desktop usage scenarios, and synthetic benchmarks are like standardized testing: they only show how good a platform is at running the synthetic benchmark. This type of benchmark stresses only very specific parts of each chip at a time, rather than how well it does a general task, and then boil down the complexity and nuances of each chip into a single numeric score, which is not a remotely accurate way of representing processors with vastly different capabilities and designs. It would be like gauging how well a person performs a manual labor task based on averaging only the speed of every individual muscle in the body, regardless of if, or how much, each is used. A specific group of muscles being stronger or weaker than others could wildly skew the final result, and grossly misrepresent performance of the person as a whole. Real world program performance will be the key in determining the success and future of this transition, and it will have to be great on this 12"" model, but not just in a limited set of tasks, it will have to be great at \*everything\*. It is intended to be the first Horseman of the Apocalypse for the Intel Mac, and it better behave like one. Consumers have been expecting this, especially after 15 years of Intel processors, the continued advancement of Apple‚Äôs processors, and the decline of Intel‚Äôs market lead.

The point of this ‚Äúdemonstration‚Äù model is to ease both users and developers into the desktop ARM ecosystem slowly. Much like how the iPhone X paved the way for FaceID-enabled iPhones, this 12"" model will pave the way towards ARM Mac systems. Some power-user type consumers may complain at first, depending on the software compatibility story, then realize it works just fine since the majority of the computer users today do not do many tasks that can‚Äôt be accomplished on an iPad or lower end computer. Apple needs to gain the public‚Äôs trust for basic tasks first, before they will be able to break into the market of users performing more hardcore or ‚ÄúPro‚Äù tasks. This early model will probably not be targeted at these high-end professionals, which will allow Apple to begin to gather early information about the stability and performance of this model, day to day usability, developmental issues that need to be addressed, hardware failure analysis, etc. All of this information is crucial to Stage 4, or possibly later parts of Stage 3.

The 2 biggest concerns most people have with the architecture change is app support and Bootcamp.

Any apps released through the Mac App Store will not be a problem. Because App Store apps are submitted as LLVM IR (‚ÄúBitcode‚Äù), the system can automatically download versions compiled and optimized for ARM platforms, similar to how App Thinning on iOS works. For apps distributed outside the App Store, thing might be more tricky. There are a few ways this could go:

* Developer will need to build both x86\_64 and ARM version of their app - App Bundles have supported multiple-architecture binaries since the dawn of OS X and the PowerPC transition
* Move to apps being distributed in an architecture-independent manner, as they are on the App Store. There is some software changes that are suggestive of this, such as the new architecture in dyld3.
* An x86\_64 instruction decoder in silicon - very unlikely due to the significant overhead this would create in the silicon design, and potential licensing issues. (ARM, being a RISC, ‚Äúreduced instruction set‚Äù, has very few instructions; x86\_64 has thousands)
* Server-side ahead-of-time transpilation (converting x86 code to equivalent ARM code) using Notarization submissions - Apple certainly has the compiler chops in the LLVM team to do something like this
* Outright emulation, similar to the approach that was taken in ARM releases of Windows, but received extremely poorly (limited to 32-bit apps, and very very slow)There could be other solutions in the works to fix this but I am not aware of any. This is just me speculating about some of the possibilities.

As for Bootcamp, while ARM-compatible versions of Windows do exist and are in development, they come with their own similar set of app support problems. Microsoft has experimented with emulating x86\_64 on their ARM-based Surface products, and some other OEMs have created their own Windows-powered ARM laptops, but with very little success. Performance is a problem across the board, with other ARM silicon not being anywhere near as advanced, and with the majority of apps in the Windows ecosystem that were not developed in-house at Microsoft running terribly due to the x86\_64 emulation software. If Bootcamp does come to the early ARM MacBook, it more than likely will run like very poorly for anything other than Windows UWP apps. There is a high chance it will be abandoned entirely until Windows becomes much more friendly to the architecture.

I believe this will also be a very crucial turning point for the MacBook lineup as a whole. At present, the iPad Pro paired with the Magic Keyboard is, in many ways, nearly identical to a laptop, with the biggest difference being the system software itself. While Apple executives have outright denied plans of merging the iPad and MacBook line, that could very well just be a marketing stance, shutting the down rumors in anticipation of a well-executed surprise. I think that Apple might at least re-examine the possibility of merging Macs and iPads in some capacity, but whether they proceed or not could be driven by consumer reaction to both products. Do they prefer the feel and usability of macOS on ARM, and like the separation of both products? Is there success across the industry of the ARM platform, both at the lower and higher end of the market? Do users see that iPadOS and macOS are just 2 halves of the same coin? Should there be a middle ground, and a new type of product similar to the Surface Book, but running macOS? Should Macs and iPads run a completely uniform OS? Will iPadOS ever see exposed the same sort of UNIX-based tools for IT administrators and software developers that macOS has present? These are all very real questions that will pop up in the near future.

The line between Stage 3 and Stage 4 will be blurry, and will depend on how Apple wishes to address different problems going forward, and what the reactions look like. It is very possible that only 12‚Äù will be released at first, or a handful more lower end model laptop and desktop products could be released, with high performance Macs following in Stage 4, or perhaps everything but enterprise products like Mac Pro will be switched fully. Only time will tell.

# Stage 4 (the end goal):

Congratulations, you‚Äôre made it to the end of my TED talk. We are now well into the 2020s and COVID-19 Part 4 is casually catching up to the 5G = Virus crowd. All Macs have transitioned fully to ARM. iMac, MacBooks Pro and otherwise, Mac Pro, Mac Mini, everything. The future is fully Apple from top to bottom, and vertical integration leading to market dominance continues. Many other OEM have begun to follow in this path to some extent, creating more demand for a similar class of silicon from other firms.

The remainder here is pure speculation with a dash of wishful thinking. There are still a lot of things that are entirely unclear. The only concrete thing is that Stage 4 will happen when everything is running Apple‚Äôs in- house processors.

By this point, consumers will be quite familiar with the ARM Macs existing, and developers have had have enough time to transition apps fully over to the newly unified system. Any performance, battery life, or app support concerns will not be an issue at this point.

There are no more details here, it‚Äôs the end of the road, but we are left with a number of questions.

It is unclear if Apple will stick to AMD's GPUs or whether they will instead opt to use their in-house graphics solutions that have been used since the A11 series of processors.

How Thunderbolt support on these models of Mac will be achieved is unknown. While Intel has made it openly available for use, and there are plans to have USB and Thunderbolt combined in a single standard, it‚Äôs still unclear how it will play along with Apple processors. Presently, iPhones do support connecting devices via PCI Express to the processor, but it has only been used for iPhone and iPad storage. The current Apple processors simply lack the number of lanes required for even the lowest end MacBook Pro. This is an issue that would need to be addressed in order to ship a full desktop-grade platform.

There is also the question of upgradability for desktop models, and if and how there will be a replaceable, socketed version of these processors. Will standard desktop and laptop memory modules play nicely with these ARM processors? Will they drop standard memory across the board, in favor of soldered options, or continue to support user-configurable memory on some models? Will my 2023 Mac Pro play nicely with a standard PCI Express device that I buy off the shelf? Will we see a return of ‚ÄúMac Edition‚Äù PCI devices?

There are still a lot of unknowns, and guessing any further in advance is too difficult. The only thing that is certain, however, is that Apple processors coming to Mac is very much within arm‚Äôs reach.",1

"Apple December 2019 Event | Live Event Thread *Tim Cook voice*

&amp;#x200B;

**GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING! GOOD MORNING!**

&amp;#x200B;

\#Right now there is an Apple media event in NYC that started at 4pm EST.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Loved by millions. Created by the best.

&amp;#x200B;

Apple is honoring its **""favorite apps and games of 2019.""**

&amp;#x200B;

This event will NOT be live-streamed so we will need to rely on live-blogs and real-time tweeting from attendees.

&amp;#x200B;

This event is the first of it's kind, so we really don't know what to expect.

&amp;#x200B;

From MacRumors:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It's not clear if any hardware will be introduced at the event, but it seems unlikely given the clear wording of the media invites. We're still expecting Apple to release the Mac Pro and Pro Display XDR in December, so there could be a mention of an official launch date, but beyond that, no more hardware refreshes are rumored for this year.

&amp;#x200B;

From 9to5Mac:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;It seems very unlikely but could Apple sneak in a ‚ÄúOne more thing‚Ä¶‚Äù at the event as a holiday surprise and show off or announce AirTag or something else? Maybe some plugs or more details on the Mac Pro launch that‚Äôs slated for December?",1

"AirPods Pro vs. Powerbeats Pro vs. WF-1000XM3 (Bonus: vs. WH-1000XM3) I know a lot of people have been wondering how the AirPods Pro stack up against some other competitors. Now that I have the 3 mentioned in the title and have been able to compare, I thought I would do so. Throwing in the over-ear Sony WH-1000XM3's just for comparison on the ANC, since they're in a completely different category.

**UPDATE 2/1/20** I got a pair of Master &amp; Dynamic's [MW07+ wireless earbuds](https://imgur.com/a/hNJAgch) for review and have added them to this review.

https://imgur.com/a/FkBRRAm

Let's start with ANC, since that's the big new feature of the AirPods Pro:

**Active Noise Cancellation**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **N/A** 
* WF-1000XM3 (in-ear): **8/10**
* WH-1000XM3 (over-ear): **10/10**
* MW07+: **3/10**

Hands down the over-ear Sonys win out of the bunch - nothing can substitute over-ear cans when it comes to ANC. That being said, the in-ear WF-1000XM3's do a really great job, and the AirPods come in just below that. I cranked up my Sonos system in my house last night and blasted it with white noise/airplane noise to simulate the effect, and these were the results I got. Just to clarify, the AirPods Pro ANC isn't *bad*, it just isn't the best of the bunch. It seems a lot of the reviewers who have been raving about the ANC, the AirPods Pro are their first pair of noise-cancelling headphones, so it's blowing their minds. The first pair of ANC headphones I owned (Bose QC 35 II's) blew my mind as well when I first heard the effect. Unfortunately this is the weakest selling point of the MW07+ as they barely cancel out any exterior sound, falling drastically behind the rest of the contenders in this category. 

**Sound Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **7/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **8/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **9/10**
* MW07+: **10/10**

The MW07+ just took the crown in this category! They sound fantastic across the whole range, have a huge soundstage for an IEM and are the best sounding pair of earbuds I've used thus far. The Sony's come in second with sound that is crisp, clear, with defined mids and clean bass. The Powerbeats are a little muddy in the mids and a little too bass-heavy, and the AirPods Pro come in just a notch below - overall they're just lacking the richness that comes from the other options, but still a noticeable improvement over the Airpods 1/2.

**Comfort**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **6.5/10**
* WF-1000XM3: **8.5/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

The shape of the AirPods Pro along with their light weight definitely make them the most comfortable of the bunch. The Sony's are just a notch below but are still comfortable after long listening sessions. Powerbeats are heavy and the outer piece will begin to get uncomfortable after a couple hours of wearing them. The MW07+ buds aren't necessarily the most comfortable, as they're a little on the larger and heavier side, but where they score major points is from having 4 different sized silicone tips to choose from, as well as 3 different sizes of silicone ""wings"" that you can choose to fit your ear perfectly. Aside from the Powerbeats Pro with the wraparound back, these are by far the most secure fit of any earbud I've found.

**Battery Life**

* AirPods Pro: **5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**
* MW07+: **10/10**

Not very subjective, just the facts here - AirPods Pro last 4.5hrs, Sony's last 6hrs and the Powerbeats last 9hrs per charge. Since receiving the MW07+'s, I'm going to have to knock 1 point off each of the previously reviewed buds, as they take the cake for battery life - 10 hours per charge, with 3 charges in the case, for a total of 40 HOURS. **I used these earbuds for about an hour a day for an entire month before I needed to charge the case.**

**Connectivity**

* AirPods Pro: **10/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **10/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7.5/10**
* MW07+: **6/10**

Both the AirPods Pro and Powerbeats Pro win here with Apple's H1 chip for ease of connectivity. The Sony's are just like any other 3rd party headphone that need to be manually searched for and connected, and over my last month of ownership have been responsive in their connecting to the phone. The MW07+'s unfortunately suffer from some bluetooth connectivity issues that are especially exaggerated in certain circumstances, ie. at the gym, walking around a large number of other people with wireless earbuds causes mine to skip considerably, constantly making the music stop and start and even drop out completely at times. By default the earbuds connect through the right earbud (which then sends the channel to the left earbud), and since I keep my phone in my left pocket, the dropouts are considerably worse with this default setting. A workaround I found is to disconnect from the right earbud and connect to the left earbud before going into the gym, which helps slightly with the connectivity issues but doesn't mitigate them completely.

**Call Quality**

* AirPods Pro: **9/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **5/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **6/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

AirPods call quality has always been top notch and the same goes for the Pro. With both the Powerbeats and the Sony's, people on the other end have reported hearing too much background noise, so the AirPods are the easy winner here. No complaints on the MW07+ call quality and the callers on the other end sound great.

**Case Size/Pocketability**

* AirPods Pro: **9.5/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **3/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **5/10**
* MW07+: **8/10**

While slightly larger than the original AirPods case, the Pros win again for pocketability. The Powerbeats are simply too big to be comfortable in your pocket, and the Sony's are only slightly more portable. The MW07+ case is GORGEOUS - glossy, polished stainless steel that's so sensitive to scratches they even give you a cloth pouch to keep it in. Even after diligently keeping it only inside the cloth pouch, microscratches began to appear on the case after only a week or two, so if you want to keep the case pristine your best bet is to leave it sitting out somewhere and never put it inside anything. Otherwise the side is great and it slips into any pocket easily, only slightly larger than the AirPods Pro case.

**Workout/Gym**

* AirPods Pro: **8/10**
* Powerbeats Pro: **9/10** 
* WF-1000XM3: **7/10**
* MW07+: **7.5/10**

Personally, I don't sweat all that much during my workouts so sweat/water resistance has never been high on my list of priority features for an earbud, however the AirPods and the Powerbeats are superior here in that regard. I've taken the Sony's to the gym many times and never had an issue with sweat/water damage, and their ANC being the best of the bunch definitely helps, but they are a bit heavy so during heavier reps when I am making funny faces, it tends to squeeze them out of my ears a bit. The Powerbeats are rock solid when it comes to staying in during workouts. I haven't had the chance to test the AirPods Pro in the gym just yet, so the 8/10 score is purely speculative based on how I believe they would perform, combined with some early feedback from other reviewers. It should be noted that having ANC in the gym is super helpful for drowning out exterior noises, and when I wear the Powerbeats I have to turn my music up considerably louder. As mentioned in the connectivity section, the MW07+'s have trouble at the gym, presumably from all of the other bluetooth headphone connections floating around there. That being said, the fit is so secure that they have taken the second place spot behind the Powerbeats Pro at the gym for me because they don't fall out no matter how vigorous the exercise is.

Ultimately these are all very different buds for very different purposes. Go with the AirPods Pro if you want decent noise cancellation, decent audio quality, easy connectivity, comfort, and you're willing to plop down $250. Go with the Powerbeats if you are ok without noise cancellation, if you want good audio quality (a little bass heavy) but needs something that will stay latched on your ear through even the most intense of workouts. And go with the Sony's if you want excellent audio quality, excellent noise cancellation, and are ok with putting the person on the other end of the line through some less than stellar call quality. At $300 for the MW07+'s, they're definitely not priced for everyone, but if you want the best audio quality of this whole bunch, and a beautiful design that stands out from the rest, this is your pair.

Hope this helps anyone on the fence in deciding between all these awesome buds!",1

"Beware, you can buy OS X Lion from Apple.com, but you can‚Äôt download it. It all started when I received a 2008 white MacBook from a friend asking me to wipe and restore. No problem! I said. I‚Äôm sure I can boot from recovery. 

Well it turns out the model didn‚Äôt have a recovery partition and it didn‚Äôt support the Internet recovery firmware either. 

So I needed to find or make an OS X Lion install DVD. I googled around and found that Apple still sells OS X Lion on Apple.com! It‚Äôs a downloadable product! Perfect! I purchased it for $19.99 and waited a day for the email with my App Store code to arrive. 

The next day I received the code and entered it into the App Store on my 2018 MacBook Pro running MacOS Catalina. I expected to be able to download it, and burn it to a DVD as I have in the past with previous version of OS X. 

The App Store took my code but I couldn‚Äôt find it in my purchases tab. Dang it! I searched around for a couple hours before turning to Apple support. It was already past support hours and so I would have to wait. 

The next day I got on with Apple.com support chat who assured me that the download should be in the App Store, and no they couldn‚Äôt refund me because the code was already redeemed. They asked me to phone technical support. 

I then spent 3 hours on the phone with 5 different people trying to figure this out. To their credit one of the techs tried in vain to find a direct download link outside of the App Store. Finally the last tier, a Senior Supervisor explained that there is no way to download OS X Lion from the App Store. It was intended as an update package for systems running Snow Leopard. This was not made clear at all on the purchase page. 

He called my nearest Apple Store and arranged for them to wipe and re image the computer. 

Unfortunately, Apple.com team couldn‚Äôt issue a refund because the code had been redeemed. It‚Äôs hard coded into their system. However, they admitted I deserved a refund, and so they were able to apply the refund towards a previous purchase in my account. 

I‚Äôm writing this post up for anyone who may have spent hours searching for the exact same issue. And a warning for anyone who may be thinking about purchasing OS X Lion from the Apple Store!

TLDR: purchased OS X Lion from Apple.com, but there is no way to download it in 2020.",1

"Amazing long term iPhone 3G support I must say, I was amazed by long term support Apple has for their products.

It turns out, the iPhone was actually operator locked, so I asked the old operator to unlock it - they could not because it is no longer in their system. So I prepared to just back the stuff and maybe find her a good condition SE, and to my amazement - once you plug an operator locked iPhone (with the new sim in) into iTunes, not only it recognizes the 11 years old device, but it automatically proposes you to remove the operator lock.

Honestly, I think it is quite amazing that they did this for an ""unsupported"" device - it enables you to use it for much longer than you would expect (I suppose other unsupported phones will behave in the same way, although I have no way to test this).",1

"This is quite possibly the single biggest software UI design problem affecting the tech world today. It's everywhere from Netflix to YouTube to Apple Music to the new Apple TV app. **The overuse of curation, where the entire interface is built around suggestions and recommendations - to the point that the entire UI feels like one big advertisement.**

This is something that has been bugging me for some time and I think a lot of people can relate. The tech world has become far too obsessed with curation and that has really harmed the end user experience. Curation (for TV shows, movies, music, etc...) is an important feature to suggest new content to check out, but it should be a feature, NOT the foundation of the user interface. That just makes for a bad UX because it makes the entire interface feel like one giant advertisement.

We see this problem across the tech world - from YouTube to Netflix to Apple Music and now the Apple TV app - and I think we need to see a shift in focus. Curation should be a feature, not the entire paradigm around which an app is built.

Here's what I mean: **[Curation Should Be A Feature, Not A User Interface](https://medium.com/@heyyoudvd/curation-should-be-a-feature-not-a-user-interface-ae52384bc30c)**

This has been terrible for several years now with regards to Apple Music, and now the same issue is popping up with the emergence of Apple TV.

-------------------------------------------

**Here's how Apple TV should work:**

**Apple:** *Hey, we've got this great new TV app that functions as a repository for all your content. You pick and choose what 'Channels' you want, you order them within the TV app, and the TV app functions as a central repository for all your content, all organized in one unified UI that's accessible via any of your Apple devices and controllable via Siri. You sign up for Channels, those media companies get paid, and we get a cut of that for providing the unified service, just like with our App Store model. Oh, and we'll throw in our own TV+ channel for free, as a perk to entice you into this TV ecosystem!*

**Users:** *Awesome! Here are the 15 shows I want to watch! I'll order all the services I need in order to get those 15 shows, and then you'll provide a UI where I can track and watch those 15 shows!*

**Apple:** *Will do!*

-------------------------------------------

But that's not how it works. The ""Watch Now"" tab is a complete mess, with everything from every streaming service (including TV+) being thrown at you like a series of ads. I think what **SHOULD** happen is the ""Up Next"" functionality should be dramatically expanded and given its own tab, so that it functions like I highlighted above - you add the shows you're watching and it functions like one of those TV show tracker apps, to keep track of everything you've watched, allowing you to rate each episode, telling you when the next episode airs, and of course, allowing you to watch it.

The ""Watch Now"" tab will continue to exist, but maybe it can be renamed ""Browse"" or ""Recommendations"" so that it continues to curate and recommend content for you. But once you see things that interest you, you'd add them to the new tab, which can be called ""Collection"", or maybe even the ""Library"" tab could be converted into this.

**tl;dr - The Apple TV app should add a new tab in which you can add all the shows across all streaming services/'Channels' you want, and you'd have a UI that functions like one of those TV tracker apps, listing all the shows you're currently following, your progress, your ratings for each episode, the next air dates, and of course, allowing you to watch the next episode.**",1

"Moving from S10+ to iPhone 11 Pro - An In-Depth Review and Comparison I'm someone who has used many flagship Android phones in the past 6 years - namely LG G4, S6 Edge+, S7 Edge, S9 and S10+. I'm an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I'm not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I've used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bg2bb2/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bo2ohn/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10/).

I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.

My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4"" S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the ""smaller"" Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the ""smaller"" iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).

**Performance &amp; Software Experience**

The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won't know the feeling that I'm talking about.

For sure, I miss the S10+'s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It's really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone's software is usually supported for \~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I'm wrong).

**Processor Disparity**

The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What's even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won't be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US/Hong Kong/South Korea/Canada?). It's like you're using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying.¬†

This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won't have to think about importing.

**RAM Management**

Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don't need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it's not a huge deal since the iPhone's performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.

**Display**

The S10+¬†has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn't bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn't overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+'s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in *Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration*¬†and *Camera*), so I'm not too annoyed at that.¬†

For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro's cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I'm someone who can always tell the difference between FHD/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.

Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6/S7/S9/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than ""One Hand Operations"" and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can't put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro's slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.

**Camera**

Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR'd. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn't soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I'd still be fine with it today.¬†

Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+'s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone's.

**Physical Build**

This is all preference here, and I think they're both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.

**Inputs and Storage**

The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn't enough for me. A ""pro"" phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.

**Battery**

The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I'm regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I'll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro's battery holds up.

Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.

**Speakers**

Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It's just slightly louder I think.

**Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness**

For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have [annoying and intrusive ads](https://i.imgur.com/DTqN7Uqr.jpg) on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don't want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don't want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don't want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it's not a huge deal.

For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn't mean all apps are ""bad"" on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.

The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don't use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like ""Samsung Browser"", ""Samsung Health"" and ""Sound Assistant"" from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you'll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like ""PaymentFramework UI"" update from Galaxy Store, or ""Billing"" or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung/Android just feels a bit weird.

**File Management**

S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to.¬†

**Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button**

I personally don't like to use my voice too much, but here's my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn't a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.

For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into ""car mode"" when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can't just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.

The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn't perfect.

The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don't like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn't have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.

**Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration**

The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn't that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it's just a camera image based scanner so it isn't secure at all, doesn't work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.¬†¬†

The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn't turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn't have an issue with!¬† The iPhone's proximity sensor works fine.

Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a ""loose vibration"" where as the iPhone vibration feels more ""compact and precise"" - hard to describe.

Overall, the biometrics, sensors and ""little things"" are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.

**Contactless Payment**

Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+¬† the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn't available. So when someone gives you the ""we don't have pay-wave"", you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I've only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.

Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn't bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).

The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it's located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn't a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.

**Price ($AUD) and Value**

Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be that much more expensive than an S10+.

However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.

**Verdict**

Taking all these factors into account, right now I'd personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.

"iOS 13 Has a Built-in Decibel Meter That Works with Apple/Beats Headphones After requesting a feature like this for years, I‚Äôm thrilled to be able to share that iOS 13 has a headphone decibel meter that actively tracks loudness levels. It‚Äôs able to provide average listening levels sorted by day and headphone type, as well as a real-time decibel level. 

Reasonable listening levels prevent hearing loss, but also mean that music is able to sound its best. Listening at above 90dB causes a reflex where the ear  tries to protect itself to limit damage, which leads to a muffled listening experience and a desire to continuously listen louder. I‚Äôve noticed a dangerous trend where consumers will instinctively set the volume to max, then complain that their headphones don‚Äôt get loud enough ‚Äî this is the reason. 

It‚Äôs calibrated to work accurately with Apple/Beats headphones for obvious reasons, but it‚Äòs capable of providing an estimate for any headphone.

Find it in the Health app - Hearing - Headphone Audio Levels.

It‚Äôs socially responsible to promote this feature, and build upon it so it isn‚Äôt just buried in the Health app.",1

"I Redesigned Apple Maps and Replicated an Apple Product Launch for it TL;DR: I took a lot of feedback (a lot from r/apple) and decided to redesign Apple Maps with features many have people have been requesting for years, plus a few that I think might add value. Check out my in-depth [case study blog post](https://medium.com/@aymanjaddaa/i-redesigned-apple-maps-and-replicated-an-apple-product-launch-for-it-468a03f10c92) or visit [aymanjaddaa.com](https://aymanjaddaa.com) to just see the visuals.

‚Äì‚Äì

Over the past couple of months, I have been working on a project that I am finally ready to show to the world, and I‚Äôm really excited about it. I redesigned Apple Maps and came up with 2 potential apps Apple should consider developing - Apple Carrier, and Apple Authenticator. I'm posting this from my official account, I'm more active here on my throwaway account :)

For a long time, I‚Äôve wanted to use Apple Maps more (and I'm sure you do too); the apps‚Äô tight integration within the Apple ecosystem is something that I treasure, but I never really saw myself using it too much because using Google Maps was just so much easier, more reliable, and more fully-fledged. Things took a turn when iOS 13 came out this year, and my opinion took a 180¬∞ turn. I‚Äôve been using Apple Maps much more often ever since, but I still found that it had a lot of missing features that many other navigation apps had implemented years ago, and I wasn‚Äôt alone in this; many other users also help this opinion. I thought to myself: ‚Äúwhy not try designing a version of Apple Maps that many users have been asking for?‚Äù So I gave it a shot at designing what the future Apple Maps might look like. 

The main objectives of this project were to (1) incorporate all the feedback many Apple users (especially in r/apple) had for Apple Maps and come up with a viable solution, (2) showcase my product design skills, and (3) have fun with this process. 

Just to point out, this was all done in good faith; massive kudos to the Maps team for all their amazing work. All odds were against them since day 1, but they‚Äôre surely getting there. I really hope someone from the team sees my work and sees my ideas.

It was really exciting, eye-opening, and a lot of fun, and I‚Äôm so excited to finally have the world see my work. If you know anyone who would be interested in my skill sets, all I ask is if you have enjoyed my work (which I‚Äôm confident you will), to please share it with your friends, peers, co-workers, hell, even your dog (just kidding, of course).

"Why Apple didn't go to 14"": some math and notes on human perception With the release of the [new 13"" MBP](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/05/apple-updates-13-inch-macbook-pro-with-magic-keyboard-double-the-storage-and-faster-performance/), many are disappointed that Apple did not increase the screen size to 14"".  Surely, all it would take is shrinking the bezels, right?  Well, actually no, the whole thing would need to get bigger, which is no good for a portable model.  Read on to find out why.

* **A chassis size increase was required to go from 15"" to 16""**

Many think that all it took to get to 16"" was a bezel shrink, but this isn't the case.  The chassis also got larger in every dimension by a small amount. Shrinking the bezels wasn't quite enough to get to 16"". In the diagonal dimension (not screen size, chassis size) the old 15"" was 16.6"" diagonally (13.75 x 9.48), the new 16"" is 17.1"" diagonally (14.09 x 9.68).  That's 0.4"" or nearly half an inch increase.  You can easily see this if you [lay the computers on top of each other](https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2019/11/16in-macbook-pro-size-compare-100818641-orig.jpg).

* **The 15"" was actually 15.4"". The 13"" is actually 13.3""**

This means to increase from 13"" to 14"", Apple would need to go an additional 1/10th of an inch beyond what they did for the 15"". So, if it took a 0.4 inch chassis increase to go from 15"" to 16"", it'd take a ~0.5 inch increase to go from 13"" to 14"". There's also less bezel to shrink overall, so it could be even larger than that.

* **Humans perceive changes logarithmically, i.e. relative to the original amount**

According to the [Weber-Fechner Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber%E2%80%93Fechner_law), humans perceive changes relative to the original amount, not relative to the absolute amount changed.  So, an increase from 20 to 30 (50% increase) will _feel_ larger than an increase from 100 to 130 (30% increase), even though the second change is larger overall (30 vs. 10).

What does this mean from MBPs? Let's break it down:

- 15"" MBP, chassis diagonal measure is 16.6""
- 16"" MBP, chassis diagonal measure is 17.1""

% increase in chassis diagonal from 15"" to 16"" model: **2.4%**.  Not really noticeable.

- 13"" MBP, chassis diagonal measure is 14.6""
- Theoretical 14"" MBP, chassis diagonal would be 14.6 + 0.6 = 15.2""

% increase in chassis diagonal from 13"" to 14"" model: minimum **4.1%**.  Much more noticeable.

So, while that half inch increase was nearly imperceptible on the 16"", it'd be roughly twice as noticeable on a 14"" model.  The numbers are even more striking if you look at area/footprint: a 14"" model would have a roughly **8% larger footprint** than the 13"", while the 16""'s footprint is only 4% larger than the 15""'s.  An 8% increase in footprint would feel significant!

See the full breakdown [in spreadsheet form here](https://imgur.com/a/MQY6D9e).

* **The 13"" is supposed to be the portable model**

Apple may have prototyped a 14"" model, in the end it didn't feel like a portable computer, just a cramped version of the 15"" MBP.  This runs counter to the whole purpose of the machine in the lineup: a portable Pro computer.

**Edit/Note:** Good discussion going on down there.  I'd like to point out that of course, this is all just speculation/conjecture on my part, and it's possible the reason there isn't a 14"" is just that it was cheaper to use the old design this year.  But, figured this food for thought was worth sharing!

**Edit 2**:  A lot of people are asking ""Why didn't Apple just shrink the bezels and keep the footprint the same, then?""  I don't know the answer, but there are a few things to consider. 1) Apple does not round up when advertising screen sizes, so a 13.7"" MBP would still be called 'The 13"" Macbook Pro' (please, find me a counter example if you think this is not the case).  2) Sourcing new panels is expensive, especially in new sizes.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Display_size) indicates 13.3 and 14"" are standard 16:10 LCD sizes, but between them is uncharted territory.  3) Apple rarely makes expensive changes unless then can make a big splashy ad for them.  Spending gobs of cash to bump the bezels 0.4 inches, without even being able to change the branding of the product, is probably just a no-go.  So, it was 14"" or bust.  Apple chose bust!

"My friends and I recreated macOS Big Sur by renting a helicopter after Craig Federighi possibly called us out at WWDC For a little context, my friends and I recreated every one of Apple‚Äôs default ‚ÄúCalifornia location‚Äù themed macOS wallpapers. [Here‚Äôs a link](https://youtu.be/5yZuaAQKnkY) to our first video (macOS Mojave, Yosemite, Sierra, etc), and [here‚Äôs a link](https://youtu.be/txIUXG29vzc) to us recreating macOS Catalina. If you want to see how we recreated macOS Big Sur, [here‚Äôs a link to the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UMtlKWrM7qM) we just released! If not, here‚Äôs a little recounting of the experience.

A month ago at WWDC, Craig Federighi said during his macOS announcement that their crack marketing team had ‚Äúspawned a host of imitators‚Äù that were copying them. At first we thought Apple was referring to us, but we don‚Äôt really believe that so much now. We‚Äôll let you guys be the judges of that!

Anyways, when Apple announced their new operating system was macOS Big Sur we were in for a challenge. The photo they took for their wallpaper ended up being 4000 feet above the California coast. Not only can you not fly a drone off the coast of Big Sur (it‚Äôs a ‚Äòno fly zone‚Äô) but also the picture was taken too high in the sky for a drone to legally fly (and it would almost certainly be out of range / connection to the controller).

So, my friends and I had one choice, we had to get a helicopter to fly us over Big Sur. After talking to an aerial photographer, we got connected with a pilot, who funny enough was the same pilot that helped Apple take the photo (shoutout Chris from Specialized Helicopters -- he was amazing!!)

The problem was Apple‚Äôs photo was taken in the winter. And since it‚Äôs summer, that means that the sun will rise differently and at a different time. Moreover, June is known for coastal fog, so it was up to chance whether or not we would get a clear day. 

The day we were scheduled to fly, Big Sur was covered in fog. Zero visibility. We waited all day for an opening, and when we finally gave up on getting the shot, there was a clearing. We raced to get in the helicopter and take off. But, by the time we made it out to the coast, the fog had moved in. We had failed.

Three days later we made our way back to Specialized Helicopters at dawn to try again. We had checked the webcams and Big Sur was looking partly covered. Our pilot told us things would only get worse, and we might as well try to make our way to Bixby Bridge. So, with our fingers crossed we took off, and when we reached the coast it was clear (besides a little haze).

Finding the spot in the air where Apple took the shot was also difficult. We had looked at Google Earth to guess the height they were at, and we used Bixby Bridge and coast lines to frame the photo. In the end we did 4 passes until we were sure we got the shot.

If you want to see the side by side, [here‚Äôs a link](https://imgur.com/WddRsBD). Unfortunately, it was very hazy the day we went to get the photo, but it would be hard to get a completely accurate match until winter! It was more about the journey anyways. None of us had ever been in a helicopter before, and this adventure is one we'll never forget!",1

"Chinese Spyware Pre-Installed on All Samsung Phones (&amp; Tablets) I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**. We really like your devices, please give us a reason to continue buying them.",0

"US Senators introduce bill to FORCE all device and software providers in the US to build backdoors into their products. Bill would make encryption illegal for American-made Android software unless it had a backdoor for the US government (Original post removed due to technicality. Repost:)

**Article:**

https://www.androidauthority.com/lawful-access-to-encrypted-data-1132922/

Full Bill: [Click here](https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/press/rep/releases/graham-cotton-blackburn-introduce-balanced-solution-to-bolster-national-security-end-use-of-warrant-proof-encryption-that-shields-criminal-activity#:~:text=The%20Lawful%20Access%20to%20Encrypted%20Data%20Act%20would%20bring%20an,devices%2C%20platforms%2C%20and%20systems.&amp;text=This%20type%20of%20%E2%80%9Cwarrant%2Dproof,the%20internet%20for%20illicit%20purposes.)

**Relevance to Android:**

Think of all the Android apps/software you use that use encryption. If this bill passes, all such software made by American companies or organizations (Signal, Whatsapp, etc.), would be illegal (at least for Americans) unless the software had a backdoor built into it for the US government to be able to access the encrypted data.

The law establishes a precedent for other nations to follow, and for further legislation to be passed, such as requiring encryption data to be unencrypted on demand (like in Australia), or outlawing encryption outright. The EFF has already spoken out about it (it's even worse than the EARN IT Act from three months ago). For these reasons, even non-Americans should be concerned.

It does nothing to stop criminals, either. They will continue downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices. All it will do is give a **huge** blow to average Americans who use American software. There will be obvious security problems having a built-in backdoor (criminals and hackers would exploit it), and the bill would set the precedent that encryption and privacy are bad/illegal/etc. Many businesses might leave the country, and people would lose their privacy.

**If you are an American:**

[Contact your two US senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Tell them to vote **NO** on the **Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act**

https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm

If your senator says they support the bill because ""encryption helps child traffickers and terrorists"", respond with the aforementioned reasons listed above. The reality line is: it won't stop criminals.",0

"YouTube's terms of service are changing and I think we should be wary of using ad block, YouTube Vanced, etc. Here's why... There is an upcoming change to the YouTube ToS that states that:

&gt;YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account‚Äôs** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO. I'm not trying to take risks with my Google account that I've been using for over a decade, and I doubt others want to either. Sorry if that's ""misleading"".",0

"How Apple removing the charging port scares me as an Android user Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it. Otherwise, there is a high chance history will repeat itself.",0

One of my favorite features was the ability to easily Bluetooth pair things. No more ""what's the device name?"" ""Why isn't it showing up yet?"" ""What's the connection pin?"" Just.. *touch* and you're done

Then I realized because if manufactures started pushing NFC, only android users would be able to take advantage of it. Even tho iPhones have NFC chips, they have them restricted to payments only. It's really frusterating to me, our phones already have the chips, it already only costs cents to make the tags, yet the technology goes mostly unused

EDIT: I know iPhones can pay with NFC. That's not the point. I'm saying they should be able to do more then just payments.",0

The answer is that it does not use any function of 360 Security app, but outsourcing only DB checking for unnecessary files.

Deletion logic is handled by Samsung's logic, and it is said that 360 DB is used to check the Junk File that can delete files.

"Sony's innovation to Android ecosystem is so underrated.. When Apple introduced the new iPad Air with the fingerprint sensor embedded at the power button, [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-integrates-touch-id-fingerprint-unlock-into-top-button-on-new-ipad-air/) said the following:

""Android device makers, like¬†Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones. 

Some of the popular features that we take for granted in Android has been introduced/popularized by Sony like IP-water resistance (as [early as 2013 in Xperia Z](https://techland.time.com/2013/07/10/sony-xperia-z-review/) , extra-tall displays, Stamina mode for battery longevity, 960fps recording etc.. Also, Sony has contributed so much to the Android AOSP and features such as[ Android theming](https://www.androidcentral.com/waiting-dawn-new-android-theming-era)  and [high res Bluetooth audio ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music) was borne out of Sony's contributions. 

Hopefully, more Android makers will adopt Sony's [charge and play](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-gaming-feature-charge-and-play-without-degrading-battery-health-h-s-power-control/amp/) battery mode, as it will help the battery.

Sony phones are so underrated.

"Samsung Galaxy Note 9 Display Issue - The scam that Samsung doesn't want to admit I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green. 

Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.

This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.

Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. 

And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.

2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.

More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

"[TIPS] Getting the best out of Android I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted.

 Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 

1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  
Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   
To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 &lt;package\_name&gt;.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device / OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-10/how-to/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))


2. **Privacy:** 
   1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_IN) 
   2. More privacy options can be found in settings / app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.
   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempmail&amp;hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.
   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&amp;hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&amp;hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.
   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.
   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video / Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).


3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.
   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https://blokada.org/index.html) **/** [**DNS66**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.
   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md))
   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https://dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)


4. **Performance and battery:**
   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.
   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines / Tasker can be used to enhance battery life / performance, like
      1. Turn off Mobile Data / Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.
      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.
      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.
      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)
   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.
   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.
   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.
   6. Prefer Dark / Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.
   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.
   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.


5. **Other tips:**
   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https://vanced.app/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.
   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.
   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.
   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.
   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings-&gt;App-&gt;Default Apps.
   6. Using [**Your phone**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&amp;hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&amp;hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.
   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_IN) for more. 
   8. [**Hermit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&amp;hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.
   9. [**Firefox Send**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&amp;hl=en_IN) can be used to send files &lt; 2GB to anyone through a link.
   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&amp;hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.
   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.
   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.
   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.


PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.

I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.

"As a deaf man, Google's accessibility features were the sole reason I bought Pixel 4 XL instead of Apple or Samsung. So far not disappointed. Update: This got more views than I expected, thank you for Gold and all the feedback, I found some new things about the phone's WiFi and Charging I'll update them with. 

I feel I should make clear of my hearing disability, it's not like regular hearing loss that can often be overcome with hearing aids. I have auditory neuropathy, symptoms are a headache to explain but to simplify, I hear sounds at near normal volume but I have difficulty understanding what words were spoken. With this disability, lip reading is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to communicate. Regular phone calls are impossible, video calls are doable with some difficulty.

With Google showing off Android 10 few months ago the Live Caption really caught my eye. Along with Live Caption they also showed Live Transcribe. Promising to deliver Live Caption to work for phone calls in the future. 

I had the original Pixel since launch, it was inside a drawer since I used iPhone 8 daily. I had the idea of updating the old Pixel to try out Live Transcribe, it worked, good enough to use but not perfect. I could even do a phone call by setting the Pixel next to iPhone 8 on Speaker.

Since that phone call I decided I will get the Pixel 4 XL. Note that Live Transcribe is not Pixel exclusive, I tested it on my friends Galaxy S10 and Note10 both functioned well as my original Pixel. Still, I figured Pixel phones will get the updates faster than Samsung and with Live Caption already on Pixel 4 I stuck with my decision. 

Now I pre-ordered and activated two Pixel 4 XL, White for me and Orange for my wife. We have had the phone for two days now and overall very satisfied with them with couple issues as well. 


Pros: 

- Live Transcribe works and you CAN use it to transcribe phone calls! This requires you to have the phone call on Speaker in the background with Live Transcribe app opened. I could communicate with the Live Transcribe transcribing everything I say and the person I was calling. 


- Recorder is also a great addition because it Transcribes! Only English supported for now but it records and also highlights the word spoken when you play the recording later. This is very helpful and I will use it often. I imagine students could use this to take notes in class. 


- Live Caption works well, haven't tested it too much yet because it doesn't work for call/video call. For YouTube, music and podcast it worked great. Some lyrics were wrong but that's expected. 


- The phone and build quality is very different from Pixels so far. All the previous Pixels I felt they could have done this and that to improve the design but this time I feel like they finally got it. I have a clear case because I love the Black/White matte thing going on. 


- Battery life feels normal but battery charging (plugged in) with included charger is holy lightning fast in comparison to my old iPhone 8. 5% to 100% is 1 HOUR.


Update: I'm a bit wrong about exactly 1 Hour but it's not too far off, plugged in charging is very good. I also resolved Wireless charging issue but I'll post that below under Cons.  


Cons: 

- The small accessibility button in bottom right corner is gone, we now need to swipe up with two fingers to access Live Transcribe as accessibility. There's options though, you can choose to get the old fashioned Back, Home, Apps, Accessibility stickman figure, it's a setting you can switch on easily. But that takes up a screen space. Or you could simply make an icon for Live Transcribe, it's what I did and put the icon on bottom right corner. The FRUSTRATING thing is that Google added Google Assistant to BOTH bottom corners! Like WHY CAN'T WE WE CHANGE WHAT THE CORNER SWIPE DOES!? Swipe up from bottom left.. Assistant, Swipe up from bottom right.. Assistant again. Grip the phone.. Assistant. Jeez we don't need so many options. Let us adjust the corner swipe up to Accessibility or anything, I imagine a calculator or flashlight would be more useful.

- WiFi is atrocious on Pixel 4 XL. I have AT&amp;T Fiber 1000 and well, both Pixel 4 XL were struggling to get full WiFi bars in room next to router, only got full bars when I was in the same room as the router. Now I'm hoping they could fix this with an update but I'm not counting on it. 

Update: WiFi is an issue with AT&amp;T. I have tried several different WiFi today and it seems main issue is at my house. 


- 90 Hz, does it exist? I don't notice it. Then again I've read posts saying it requires certain brightness level to activate. 

Update: Comments say we can force this in developer settings. But I've also seen posts where some had screen color change after this? Or something like that. 


- WIRELESS charging feels iffy. Day 1 I could charge it fully overnight on my old 7.5w Mophie Wireless charger, it didn't fast charge, just regular charge but it worked. Day 2 both my Pixel and my wife's failed to charge overnight on same Wireless charger. The difference was that I put on Speck Presidio Clear cases on both phones Day 2. The case isn't too thick, should work with Wireless charging. Maybe the 7.5w on top of having a case was the issue. Anyway I hope a stronger charger can fix this problem because Wireless charging is a huge plus in my life. Any recommendations for a charger would be appreciated, I'm also hoping Pixel Stand goes on sale during Black Friday. If that stand even works with this case.

UPDATE: Regarding Wireless charging I feel the issue is resolved but it was expensive. Today I went to various retailers to test out WiFi and Wireless chargers on display with the Inware app to check how fast each charger worked. The results were VERY DISAPPOINTING. Every single charger tested resulted in 8.4W ‚Ä¢ Fast except the Pixel Stand. While that sounds ok I really don't think it is. Among the tested were some 15w Wireless chargers, the new Samsung 15w charging stand included, resulted in 8.4W while this sounds like an ok speed for charging overnight... They all had some issues, either didn't charge at all, charged very very slowly or randomly stopped charging like the one I had before. Now this is where I spent money to fix this problem. Pixel Stand performed ridiculously well unlike all others. It fully charged my phone to 100% without issues and did it very quickly. On the Inware app where every other charger showed 8.4W, Pixel Stand showed 13.2W(!?!) And the speed was actually very fast. I'm not sure if it's a proper indicator of charge speed but 'Currents' showed similar number to plugged in charging speed, around 1800-2000. I will try to take and upload pictures next time I charge. I'm really hoping I wake up to 100% tomorrow morning. I read that Google made Pixel 4 Wireless compatible to fast charge as long as it's over 10W + EPP standard but this doesn't seem to be the case. It is struggling to charge on other chargers. 


Update: Another Con I discovered is that we can't take proper screenshots on Pixel! I found something about the keyboard, bottom left corner we have a button to hide keyboard. This should be abled to switch either bottom left or bottom right.. not everyone is left handed. This is where the screenshot issue happens, I can't take a screenshot of my keyboard! As far as I know the only way to take screenshots on Pixel 4 seems to be holding Power button, doing so will lower my keyboard, hiding it.

"""Hey Google, I'm Being Pulled Over"" Howdy folks, You have likely seen the iOS shortcut ""I'm being pulled over"". Well Google Assistant makes it pretty easy to build something similar but not as advanced.

I wanted to provide a tutorial on how I managed something similar.

    Open Google Home
    Add Routine
    When - I'm getting pulled over
        It will auto update to 'I say ""I'm getting pulled over""'
    Add Action
        Browse Popular Actions
            Send a Text - Enter Number and ""I am having an interaction with the police please check my Google Photos for a video as my phone has started recording this incident.""
            Put Phone on Silent
            Adjust Media Volume (0)
        Enter a Command
            Turn off auto brightness
            Set my screen brightness to 0
            Turn on do not disturb        
            Take a selfie video

I chose selfie video so that I have a recording of myself so that I do not potentially violate any laws. Feel free to modify it anyway you want.

If anyone has any recommendations on how to tweak this please let me know and I will update.

\* I have shared my Google Photos with my fiance so she has access to any time. Also I am on unlimited data with Google Fi so my Google Photos is set to backup on mobile data (so no need to change that setting).

*There are some limitations for for Google Assistant and what it can automate on your phone. If you want a more complete solution look at IFTTT, Tasker, AutomateIT, and others.*

**Edit:** I am making edits as recommendations for modifications come in.

**Edit 2:** Please take a look at ACLU Mobile Justice and download the App. You can easily edit the above Routine to ask your phone to open that app:  [https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct) and at the ACLU Know Your Rights page:  [https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/)

**Edit 3:**  from [Aperture\_Kubi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aperture_Kubi) \-  Slight problem if you're trying to do this in your home and you have Google Home hardware that picks up the command instead. I tried it with the trigger being ""panic mode"" for more general use. *Summary - Any Nest or Google Home devices in your home will activate based on these hotwords as well but be unable to activate them on your phone.*

**Edit 4 REQUEST:** Has anyone been able to get Google Assistant to auto stream to any platform? If yes, please tag me in your comment and I will update the post with your instructions.

**Edit 5**: A few folks have commented on the laws of recording interactions with police. Summary: Notify the police that the interaction is being recorded. Please check with your state laws on recording during traffic stops. The ACLU link above has some great details on your rights.

**Edit 6**:  from [andyooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyooo) \-  There are apps like Nova Launcher mentioned below (and Tasker) that have a ""system lock"" action, which disables biometrics (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/) for more). This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock) and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add ""open Lock"" to your Assistant routine. If you don't trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory's developer, you can use them to make a ""system lock"" task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it's unambiguous to Assistant what it should ""open""). Going that way I'd recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.

**Edit 7**: from [xcheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcheet) \-  Google Home is not needed. Routines can be created inside Assistant using the instructions on this page: [Check Google Support](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7672035?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en) ",0

"I'm not tired of Android, but I'm tired of Google neglecting Android After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.

To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):

    - HTC Evo 4G
    - Samsung Galaxy S II (Sprint)
    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)
    - HTC Evo 3D
    - Google Nexus S
    - Google Galaxy Nexus
    - Samsung Galaxy S III (Unlocked)
    - Samsung Galaxy S4
    - HTC One X (briefly)
    - Motorola Moto X (original)
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 3
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 4
    - Google Nexus 6
    - Motorola Moto X 2015
    - Google Nexus 6P
    - Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (Unlocked)
    - Samsung Galaxy S8+ (Unlocked)
    - OnePlus 6 (Still have it in my drawer)
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 9 (Current phone)
    
About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  

---------------------------------

The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.

I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. 

- One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".

- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.

---------------------------------

But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. 

Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:

- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps

- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support

- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy

- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features

- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)

- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone

- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time

- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located

- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)

- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriers

So I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).

Does anyone else feel similar?

"Am I living in a parallel universe? SO thats a question im asking myself the last few days while reading about the new IPhone SE everywhere.

All reviews im reading or watching ( LTT , Dave Lee , etc.) are talking about the great value of this new device. But i can not wrap my head around it. 

Im one a Samsung Galaxy A51 and fail to see how this new IPhone is even close to being a ""value for your money"" phone. BUT before everyone is going ahead writing how this phone has the best mobile processor on the market - hear me out first ..

All im doing is writing Whatsapp Messages ( yea im in Europe, Germany - there is absolutely no point in iMessage over here ), browsing reddit, watching Youtube Videos ( which is amazing on such a nice big AMOLED Screen ) and taking photos ( which is super nice with the variety of cameras on the back and totally enough for my personal use - i dont need super professional photos for pesonal use on my phone and its got 128 GB of storage for everything )  While all these tasks can be done for a very long time due to 4.000 mAh battery 

Now the big thing is that all these things run smoothly - absolutely no problems whatsoever. Do most people really do more with their phones? Im talking about more demanding tasks.

From my point of view everybody fails to talk about real Budget phones ( Do they even exist in their world ) Its always about ""Big new flagship here - big new flagship there - flagship killer over there - OH THERE IS AN IPHONE FOR 479‚Ç¨ THATS HUGE BANG FOR BUCK ) ... while im on my device thats 289‚Ç¨ of the shelf and looking better for everything i do.

Where am i going wrong? Do i fail to see why the processor is such a big deal on a phone thats doing nothing for professional use? Do Tech reviewers dont know about things like the Galaxy A-Series? Or any budget Series for that matter ( I dont care at all about brands ) 

Im absolutely not bashing on Apple or Android or anything else - i really want to understand what im not seeing. Maybe someone can help me out here.

Or maybe im not the guy to know about brand-value .. maybe im just living in my own parallel Universe lol

Edit: Guys. I didn't mean to be rude - my intention was simply to understand the other point of view. There is no need for another 80 comments to point out that software support is important and how my phone will not run for 5 years but the iPhone does ( even though my SO got a Galaxy A5 (2017) which runs perfectly fine ). I do understand that (very) important argument. But nonetheless - I do still think they could have made the SE more 2020 than 2016 - still give it a good price tag and still give it software support. 
That said, please be nice to each other, I just wanted to be educated ! :) Peace to the apple folks out there

Edit #2: I've read A LOT of your comments and came to a conclusion. As someone in the comments pointed out - yes I'm living in a parallel universe. It's called Europe and is apparently ( including the res of the world ) totally different from the US I'm terms of Smartphones lol - ultimately it's like metric vs. imperial system ^^",0

One is a voice changer that is actually number one in the top grossing charts for personalization, and even has a paid advertisement when searching for voice changers in the app store. However the big issue here is after installing you find out they want you to activate a free 3 day trial. Then they charge you $200/year. Yes, TWO HUNDRED dollars. Yearly. When other apps do the same things for a one time purchase of less than $10 or even free. Being a subscription, your card on file is charged immediately after the 3 day trial ends. So clearly they are banking on people just forgetting about the trial, or people not reading the price and hoping it's just a dollar or two.

As always make sure to have your google account set to require your password for all purchases, especially if you have kids using your phone, as a child may want a voice changer app, but not quite understand the concept of money yet. 

Their other apps are a screen recorder, voice recorder, and image converter. All want a $200/year subscription, and all have paid ads that make the app appear at the top of app store search results.",0

"Anyone else feel like switching to iPhone has become more possible? I don't scroll through here that often, so I don't know the general consensus on Apple products here, so forgive me if I'm not saying anything new or if I'm deviating too much from the public opinion here I guess.

So as funny as it is to see iOS introduce old Android features as ""new"" year after year, it does make switching more of an option to me honestly. As a MacBook Pro user, I started out completely ignoring the idea of getting an iPhone to pair with my laptop better, I felt iPhones were just too limiting. But the two OS's have really started to become much more similar than before in terms of general, everyday feature set.

I don't feel like I'd miss much switching from my S10e to an iPhone now. I'd only miss freely downloading apks, YouTube Vanced (audio with the screen off for free), and GCam. But besides that, with great cameras, fast speed, grouped notifications, an app drawer, widgets, fluid animations, and so on, iOS now feels like Android with way less sacrifice than ever before. Hell, if I wanted I could get an iPhone X for less than the price of a new flagship Android and get more software updates and support than the usual Android phones and basically the same performance. 

And I'm sure now, with Android refining design, speed, and features, more iOS users are thinking Android feels like iOS with more options.

I don't know why I'm making this post exactly, I think I'm just kinda happy to see the two OS's becoming mature and optimized enough that I, a person who's never owned an iPhone, can actually see myself switching over for once.",0

"Pixel 4 supports display out through USB C but Google intentionally disabled it There has been a lot of talk about the hidden desktop mode for Android. I was wondering if Google Pixel 4 supported display out but many people have stated that it doesn't. Hardware wise, it does but for some reason unlike everyone else who supports it through hardware, Google intentionally disabled it. Wasn't sure if anyone was aware of this so I just wanted to bring attention to this with the hope of getting the attention of someone at Google to enable it. The funny thing is almost all flagship phones INCLUDING iPhone support it while pixel does not. Here is the source of information that shows the disabled function:

"After 10 years of Android, I switched to an iPhone 11 Pro. I switched back after a month. Here's a quick recap of my experience. I used Android exclusively since the T-Mobile G1. Since then, I always got the latest Android phones. That includes notable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Note 7. The Motorola Atrix. The Moto X. The Nexus 1, 4, 5, 6. Then finally the Pixel series starting with the 1, 2, 3, and now the 4.

Last month I had an itching to try something new in quarantine, so I switched from my Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 Pro. There was initially a lot to like (build quality and screen mainly), but there were so many annoying quirks that I could not stand it for more than a month.

If I could sum up my experience with the iPhone in one sentence, it would be ""Fantastic hardware, horrendous software"". iOS needs a ton of work in my opinion. Below is a recap of my issues with iOS:

&amp;#x200B;

* Notifications are a mess
   * Why are there two notification screens? ""Lockscreen"" and ""Notification center"". So many times I would think I've dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.
   * It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.
   * You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.
   * If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn't dismiss it from your notifications. I've already read it, why is it still in my notifications?
   * The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping ""by app"" in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc
* Gestures
   * You can only go ""back"" by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.
   * There is no dedicated ""back"" button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to ""swipe away"" this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.
* Home screen layout
   * Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it's such a pain in the ass. Why can't I hide apps or have an app drawer?
   * You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.
* Apps
   * Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is ""voluntary bloatware"". I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc
   * Can't set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit ""navigate"", and it opened Apple Maps. There's no way to change this behavior.
   * Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.
   * There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.
* Keyboards
   * I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.
   * If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no ""slide typing"" functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?
   * If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having ""2 apps for every app"" like I mentioned in the Apps section above.
* Camera/Photos
   * The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow
   * Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I've only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it's seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn't understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a ""live view"" of what the portrait shot will look like.
   * Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there's no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let's start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.
* Background processes
   * It's 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don't understand why.
* iMessage/FaceTime
   * FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I'm a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn't really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime's moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to ""reply to"" a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.

&amp;#x200B;

The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.

I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won't or can't fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.",0

"Smartphones after 6+ years and other things that manufacturers don't like people to know One weekend ago I wanted to test some specific custom phone ROMs out there but in the first stage I was prepared to do (potentially more destructive) tests only on the oldest Android phone I still have - a Samsung Note 3 N9005 from 2013.

So I went ahead and updated it to the latest Samsung stock (Android 5.0 from 2015 - before Samsung switched to 3 years of security updates for the flagships, old stuff but it was needed to be certain the phone has the latest baseband/modem and other separate firmware). Needless to say - security update was ancient and it was open to attacks like WiFi KRACK and probably tons of other newer attacks. Speed was not that great but that was to be expected for a device of that age.

Then I tested with two Android projects that sounded very cool - the very first one was [/e/  (formerly Eelo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system\)), which is based on [LineageOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS) but with certain improvements for privacy and for a digital life where Google does not know everything about you. It was mentioned somehow recently in articles like [this](https://uk.pcmag.com/motorola-moto-z-play-droid/123158/hands-on-with-e-a-version-of-android-that-ditches-google) or [this](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-e-google-free-pro-privacy-android-clone-is-now-available/) but also discussed [here](https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/e-foundation-first-look/) and [a response here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/leaving-apple-google-how-is-e-actually-google-free-1ba24e29efb9).

The install was in my experience simple enough (first of the above articles is saying it is not that easy, but perception of easy can be very different) and things started quite nicely, the phone was definitely snappier than with the Samsung stock firmware and all things I tested seemed to work fine. The experience was somehow limited since Google was kept outside it - on purpose.

And then I tried a more exotic project - [HavocOS 3.0](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-3/development/rom-havocos-3-0-t4000767) - a project based on Android 10 AOSP (with credits for LineageOS and a lot other projects) and ""inspired by Google Pixel"". The project has some excellent developers and maintainers - you can see those in the link above.

Installation is a little more complex (since it is an earlier beta and on Android 10 OpenGapps is still a moving target) but in the end things went fine installing BiTGApps as some people in the XDA forum were suggesting.

And this one was the special surprise - a few days back when I was playing with that I did have Android 10 with November 5 patch level on my Pixel 2XL but my (more recent) Note9 was on Android 9 November 1 patch level and the Poco F1 has only got the October 1 patch (also on Android 9). But the Note 3 from 6+ years ago now was also having Android 10 with November 5 patch level just like the Pixel, and a default launcher that was very much like the default Pixel launcher (which I normally replace with Apex Launcher Pro for consistency among all my phones, but on the Note3 I decided to give it a chance).

Anyway - long story short my ""old relict"" phone was now probably snappier than it ever was in the past (newer ART versions probably help) and on the latest security patch available to the public. It is almost as usable as any of my other phones from the signature (and in fairness with 3 GB RAM it is also the closest to the Pixel2XL from all my Android phones, all other Android phones have 6 GB RAM and that shows).

So why all this long story? Well, first of all to point that the level of updates in the normal commercial phones is a matter of commercial choice and not of technical choice - manufacturers try to support phones for the absolutely minimal amount of time they can get away with, and for the people that are not prepared to live unprotected the easy choice is just to upgrade to the latest (usually expensive) phone.

The other reason is to point to the fact that the Samsung Note3 has a removable battery (it is not even the last Note to have that, the Note4 is). And that means that the phone could probably last on open-source Android projects with up-to-date security for as long as I can still find a replacement for the batteries - which unfortunately in itself no longer seems so easy, most of what I could find was inexpensive stuff of dubious quality. But the point remains - good phones could vastly outlast the ""planned obsolescence"" built into them, but in the absence of significant regulation this ""planned obsolescence"" will just continue to creep-in and contribute to the increased amount of technological waste and pollution around us.

EDIT:

I forgot to add two links that I had saved for this post - not affiliated in any way with either one. First - if you are serious about security you might want to take a look at /r/GrapheneOS/. And if you missed this (good) video - [here](https://youtu.be/ByCDKBBhdZg) Dave Lee makes the point that (at least some) Apple phones ""age"" better - that is probably true with ""stock software"" but as this test points out it is a result of dubious software policies from Android manufacturers and not from anything intrinsic to Android itself.",0

The app has permissions to ""retrieve running apps"" and when you install it and then start using Facebook you will get a popup that looks to be from Facebook asking you to re-login. 

This is a phishing advert that then steals your Facebook login information. (Doesn't happen straight away but if you read 1* reviews on the app they all mention similar things - https://i.imgur.com/ROZtwTQ.jpg)

"PSA: Turn off RCS before switching phones Just a heads up that if you switch phones, it's a good idea to turn off RCS on the old phone first.

I got caught with this yesterday actually - switched my SIM from my Pixel to my iPhone. Missed a bunch of messages from my wife during the day because they were still going to my Pixel. 

Note that my Pixel was still on and connected to Wifi - if it wasn't, the 'Resend undelivered as SMS' option that is enabled by default might have worked, but [Google support](https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714?hl=en) also suggests turning off RCS as it may stay active for up to 8 days.

Fortunately it's not as bad as iMessage was a couple years ago where you had to tell people to delete their existing group chats and put your phone number into Apple's site to deregister it. Just hoping this saves some people from missing some messages.",0

This is a music player running Android Pie. I bought it for its intended use as well as for the cassette Walkman look. It has WiFi, Bluetooth, and the Play Store. So you can install essentially any Android app to it. Internal memory is 16 GB, but there is a microSD slot available. And, obviously, a headphone jack. There are full media controls on the side, and a Hold button for them.

There is no skin on the OS apart from a few custom apps. There is also a music volume separate from the media volume. And, most importantly for me, there is a screen that lets you force LDAC 990 kbps, or every other supported Bluetooth audio codec.

"Engineer from Samsung says chipset vendors are to blame for limited Android updates /u/LTEX90:
""I can comment on why devices usually get 2 major OS upgrades.

It's simply that chipset vendors no longer write kernels and drivers for us to implement in our devices.

It is infeasible for us to write our own kernels for all components in the device without violating patents.

If we owned all the patents, sure we will do it. I will do it. I have a Note 9 as my personal device as well and I would hate for it to not get new features after 2 years.""

It's always struck me as odd that PC-chipped computers generally don't have a software upgrade limit. Their operating systems often continue to receive upgrades far past their usable lifespan. I can't help but wonder if Qualcomm was the source of all evil for the industry trend we find ourselves in now.

"Xiaomi India replied to my mail regarding Clean Master. They will be removing the Clean Master service (by Cheetah Mobile) from the Security app via a soft update. Transcript of the mail:

Hi XXX, 

Greetings from Mi India Customer Support and sharing the screenshots with us. I am Divya and I understand that you want to remove clean master from all Indian phone variants running MIUI. Also, you want to know about the updates for the same in your POCO F1. 

We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.
Please do not worry, I will assist you with it.

I would like to inform you that you will get an update for a cleaner app, the new version is 4.1.2 which will take care of the removing extension Clean master. These updates will be pushed via system updater.

Also, as the Security app in MIUI phones used uses plug-in/definition of Clean Master which is one among the 59 apps banned by Indian Govt. We are not using the Clean Master app directly instead the service is used in the name of Cleaner under the Security app. Hence, users don‚Äôt have an option to uninstall Clean Master. So, Xiaomi is pushing a Soft Update (Update happens in the background without any notification) to remove the Clean Master Service from the Security app.

Once the update is automatically applied, our users will continue to see the Cleaner section in the Security app but it will not be the one from Clean Master instead it will use Xiaomi‚Äôs own Cleaning definition.

I hope the provided information will help you. If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact us.

Regards,
Divya
Mi India Customer Support

YouTube's flexibility as a platform and the tech reviewers being relatively new in emergence has left a gaping hole where an expectation of journalistic standards and ethics needs to be.

"How I moved my Google presence from a GSuite account to a regular account You‚Äôve probably read posts about how various Google services keep getting changed or deleted for GSuite users. This didn‚Äôt sit well with me, considering at least some of its users are paying customers.  In theory, we should get *better* treatment from Google, not worse. So over the course of a few hours, I moved the major parts of my entire Google existence going back 12 years from GSuite to a free, regular old Gmail account. I commented on a thread about this and someone asked me how I did it, so I thought I‚Äôd spell it out. I hoping to help folks and maybe discuss better ways to get it done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foreword**

This is just what I did. Your mileage may vary. Do your due diligence before messing with important data. Don‚Äôt delete anything until you know it‚Äôs safely backed up or on the new account.

Before starting, I want to point you to Google Takeout. I highly recommend using this service to download and save everything you can to somewhere safe. It takes forever, but makes parts of the process easier and at the very least, provides some peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**

* Full Google Assistant and Google Home functionality.
* Saves money if you pay for your GSuite account.
* No risk that your employer will cut you off from your account.
* Can leave Play Store app reviews.
* Custom dictionaries for Google Keyboard are saved to the cloud, if you don't have a GSuite account installed on your phone. Thanks /u/alpain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons**

* This is a lot of work.
* You‚Äôll lose your search history, online reviews and Local Guide status, music play counts, Google Assistant home control routines, minimal Google scanning of your files, and no free 150TB of storage.
* You‚Äôll lose your Google Rewards, ~~but you can use them to buy a Play Store gift card, which might be better.~~  but you can use an app called Convert King to convert them to PayPal dollars.
* I lost my $8/month Google Play Music rate, and now have to pay $12/month for YouTube Premium (which gives me GPM for free).
* You might have to tell everyone a new email address, unless you keep the old one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Email**

I didn‚Äôt want to just forward every email in my GSuite account to the new account. That would take forever, and be messy.

Google doesn‚Äôt provide an easy way to transfer your emails from a GSuite account to a regular email account, so I used Mozilla Thunderbird as an intermediate step. Add both of your accounts, and import your entire inbox into Thunderbird. Once the emails are read into Thunderbird, which took me two hours, you can right click on each folder and select ‚ÄúCopy to‚Ä¶‚Äù to send it to the other account. Very handy, and free.

After that was done, I set up IMAP checking of the old account, which conveniently pulls emails over. I also added the GSuite account info to the regular Gmail account settings, so I can select which account I want to send emails from (since I haven‚Äôt deleted my GSuite account yet).

&amp;#x200B;

**Contacts**

Use the Export function on the left of the page to save your contacts to a Google CSV file, swap to the new account, and import the file.  I think you lose contact pictures in this process, so there might be a better way to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calendar**

Settings &gt; Import &amp; Export to a file, swap to the new account, and import the file.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hangouts**

I‚Äôm one of the last remaining humans still using this utterly lame platform. Some conversations were priceless to me and I wanted to keep them, so Takeout made that pretty easy.  Unfortunately, it saves your conversation as JSON files, which aren't easy to read or import elsewhere, so I used the free decoder found by Jay2K1... this tool was really helpful.

I switched over to a better non-Google platform during the big migration, since there‚Äôs no way to import Hangouts discussions from a new account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Photos**

I thought this was going to be the end of the world, but Google actually made transferring 10 years‚Äô worth of pictures pretty easy. Just share your pictures, albums, etc. to the new account and they‚Äôll show up in your new account. Once you see them all, select them all and do a ‚Äúsave to library‚Äù to make them yours on the new account. Beware: if you‚Äôre like me and have a ton of photos on there, it takes a long time to populate. During the process, I was worried that dates and locations seemed to be wrong, but that all fixed itself by the time it was done.  Just be patient.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Play Music**

Before I tell you what I did, you should look into the app Soundiiz I mention below.  I didn't know about it when I transferred my GPM collection, and I wish I did.

I have an extensive music library on Google Play Music, so this was a huge concern for me. Doing this the hard way meant making a long list of artists, songs, and albums in my collection and individually adding them into the new account. Screw that.

The Share functionality was very useful for this. For each playlist, I shared it to the new account. Swap to the new account, accept the share, select all, and do an ‚Äúadd to library.‚Äù

But what about several thousand songs in my library that weren‚Äôt in playlists? I certainly didn‚Äôt want to select thousands of songs and individually share them over, so I made new playlists that contains my entire music collection. For example, I made a playlist with all of the songs I'd given a thumbs up, so those would be preserved.  A complication is that Google only allows 500 songs in a playlist, so I had to make like 12 new playlists. It was a pain in the ass, but it got the job done.

Another complication is uploaded music.  Back in the day, I had to upload a lot of music to GPM because it didn't exist in their library.  Today, not one song wasn't available in GPM.  This took a while, but I went through my entire collection and took note of everything I had uploaded, then added each song to my library.  If you have uploaded music that isn't in the GPM library, you might look into whether Google Takeout will download them, then swap accounts and re-upload them.

&amp;#x200B;

**YouTube**

This one was tough without help. I don‚Äôt have a lot of uploaded videos, so that part was easy: just upload the originals to the new account. If you don't have the originals, Google Takeout will download them from the old account for you.  Sure, I lost views and comments, but that‚Äôs a bonus in my opinion. Clearly, if you‚Äôre a content provider, this part might be a deal-breaker.

Playlists and subscriptions were a different story. To transfer playlists, I used app called Soundiiz, which is $4.50/month, to transfer playlists from the old account to the new one.  I used that service for a few hours and then cancelled the service. It was well worth the five bucks.

There‚Äôs no way to transfer subscriptions, so I had to manually enter those. I opened two windows side-by-side and went down the list. I have about 20, so it really only took about 5 minutes to search for a provider and click the subscribe button.

/u/F5PPu6kGqj reports that YouTube subscriptions can be exported (but maybe not imported) from with [YouTube Subscription Manager](https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager).

&amp;#x200B;

**YouTube Music**

This service is such a train wreck that I almost didn‚Äôt bother. The aforementioned Soundiiz app transferred my songs from one account to the other, but a decent number of them showed up on the new account as videos of live performances or covers by crappy bands. I attribute this to the YTM library being much, much smaller than the Google Play Music library, so it had no choice than to downgrade to whatever video it could find. Beware: you‚Äôll have to spend some time deleting these misidentifications, because some of them are really, really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

**Maps**

You‚Äôll have to set up home and work locations in your new account‚Ä¶ no big deal. For saved locations, you can use the Share function to send them to your new account, and manually save each one. I only had half a dozen, so this was easy for me. If you have a lot of them, I haven‚Äôt tried this but you can probably make a map of all of them and share the entire map.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep lists**

Keep lists are shareable, but if you delete them on the original account, they get deleted on all shared accounts. You can copy and paste from one note to another, but that is a lot of work. An easy way to do this is share each list to your new account, then switch to your new account and they‚Äôll all be there waiting for you. Select each one and choose Make a Copy, and that list will belong to you. You can delete the old list at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Web Passwords**

You can export your web site passwords stored in Chrome by going to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Passwords &gt; dot menu to the right of ""Saved Passwords"" &gt; Export Passwords.  After you switch to your new account, you can import from that file back into Chrome with Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Import Bookmarks and Settings and select Bookmarks HTML file from the pulldown.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bookmarks**

I saved off my bookmarks to a file using Google Takeout. Most web browsers have an import/export functionality. I‚Äôm dumb and use Chrome, so I used Settings &gt; Bookmarks &gt; Bookmark Manager &gt; dot menu &gt; Export to save them to a file.After you switch to your new account, you can import from that file back into Chrome with Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Import Bookmarks and Settings &gt; navigate to saved file.

&amp;#x200B;

**2FA**

To the best of my knowledge, Google Authenticate doesn't provide any means to switch to new accounts, or any backup capability.  You'll have to turn off 2FA for each account and reconnect it on your new account.

I use Authy for 2-factor authentication, for exactly this reason; Authy allows you to change email addresses. It‚Äôs a process that you should take very seriously, but it‚Äôs straight-forward and doesn‚Äôt take too long. Everything transferred with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Apps**

This was a bitter pill to swallow because I had a lot of paid apps accumulated over the years. I could live without many of them, but a few are super important to me and had to be purchased again. For free apps, I opened two browser windows, one with each account logged into the Play Store, and manually went down the list.  I use a lot of apps, but this was pretty easy and only took about half an hour to search for each one and tell it to install.  For paid apps, like I said, you‚Äôre just going to have to buy them again. I didn‚Äôt bother contacting the app authors; they‚Äôre under no obligation to help us out, but you might be able to convince them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Drive files**

I have about 50 files on my Google Drive. I used the Share function to move these over. It was pretty easy because you can share entire folders.  Once they're accessible on your new account, right click and select Make a Copy.  That will make the file belong to your new account and you can delete the old one.  This should work for all Google Docs and Sheets documents you have online.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Voice voicemails**

You can associate your GV number with a new Google account, but you can‚Äôt bring your saved voicemails or SMS messages with you. I used Google Takeout to download them all for safe keeping before I initiated the swap to the new account. There‚Äôs no way to upload them to GV once it‚Äôs linked to the new account, so I just keep them on a hard drive now.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT 1:

* Thanks for the upvotes and coinage!
* Added a link to Convert King, which lets you convert Google Rewards money to PayPal.
* Added a link to YouTube Subscription Manager.
* Added loss of minimal Google scanning of your files and free 150TB of storage to Cons.  Thanks /u/Ripdog and /u/port53.",0

"Samsung apparently removed the storage cleaner feature http://imgur.com/gallery/quCNc8A

There was an update for the app, now the storage cleaner by 360 got removed. They also updated the images so it fits to the Android 10 version.

Changelog:

[ Android 10 ]
- Android 10 is now supported.
- The look of the Battery usage page has been improved.
- Some bugs have been fixed.

[ Android 9 ]
- Some bugs have been fixed.

I analyzed the apk and the library of 360 was removed. There are some strings about 360's cleaner though

Here's the store description for an Android 8.1 device (it got updated too):

"How much do you care about haptic feedback? Personally, a good vibration motor is very important to me, but I feel like I might be in the minority. When I used an LG v10, the haptics were pretty good, but when I upgraded to a OnePlus 5t, the haptics were so ridiculously bad that I disable touch feedback in the device. After recently getting a OnePlus 7 pro, I'd say that the great haptic motor is my second favorite feature, right below the screen.

I've heard Jerryrigeverything mention that he really doesn't care about vibration motors which I find surprising, because for me, good vibration completely changes my perception of a device. What do you think?",0
"Opinion: Mainstream reviewers (The Verge, MKBHD, etc) need to start putting serious pressure on Android apps / app developers At this point, no fancy hardware feature, no Android system update, no stock-like ROM or anything you can imagine will ever bring your experience on Android to the next level. We've nearly reached the limit and everyone knows it. Improvements are extremely incremental and largely don't change how you interact with your device on a day-to-day basis.

Your time on the lock screen, the home screen, looking at the notification shade, tweaking a few niche settings to your likings; those are small moments in time. What you look at and use large and by far *are the apps themselves.*

With all that in mind, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that mainstream tech reviewers continue to harp on the same strings:

* xx GBs of RAM
* 8xx Snapdragon with +7% of performance you'll never see or use
* Screen body ratio
* etc

All this while arguably the most important piece of the puzzle is ignored. 

When mainstream reviewers are doing (for example) their showdown comparisons of the latest iPhone vs the Samsung, iPhone vs the Pixel, etc, they should be mentioning that a good portion of the Android apps are absolute dogshit. Call them out specifically such as Snapchat, Instagram &amp; Facebook. They should of course acknowledge that it's not the phone manufacturers fault, but really start giving the heat to these huge mega corporations for their continually awful treatment of Android users. I pay the same monthly bill as an iOS user on Spotify for half the experience.

On top of inserting it into occasional reviews, (which is fair as they should be reviewing the overall experience, not just listing specs and first impressions) they should also be writing articles about it. Make some noise about it. I'm aware that a few have been written in the past, but they've all gotten very quiet about it in the past years and it's helping nobody. 

If mainstream reviewers continue to shout ""If only my phone had 2 more GB of RAM! If only my screen was 0.2"" larger!"" then that's all we're going to get. Ever.

On the other hand, if the awful app experience starts to generate bad press to everyone involved, who knows, companies like Google &amp; Samsung might even take initiative to cooperate with app developers to create a better experience. Snapchat might eventually snap &amp; officially support select flagships for stock-app-like camera quality. Same with Instagram &amp; Facebook. Beyond camera quality, Samsung &amp; Google might start giving out some ... *ahem* ""incentives"" for major app devs to clean up their act.

Windows Phones were absolutely crucified for their app support. I don't know why Android seems to be getting a free pass. I'm a huge Android fanboy, and I think the only way things are going to improve is if the people with a real voice in the tech community start putting it through the ringer. Burn it and let it be reborn, like the great Phoenix. Amen. Peace to the world, save the turtles, goodbye",0

"Android's Gmail Notification Bug Important Edit: Please stop telling me how to enable things and remove optimization. I've done it all, everything possible to ""correct"" it. None of it works for me or many others out there.

[Update Post](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dtx84u/androids_gmail_notification_bug_or_is_it_update/)

So some of you may have had delayed notifications on Gmail and I believe this is concrete proof that something within Android's messaging system is faulty.

I tried every ""fix"" out there and knew deep inside that there is something wrong with something deep within the OS. 
Why would a push notification not work for GMail but works for everything else? 
Why do I need to remove battery optimization? It's a push notification and every other app registers them successfully.
So, I thought, why not factory reset the phone and see if that fixes it. Nope.

So I did what every IT person does and starts looking at the logs.

I sent myself an email at 08:13 from an Office 365 email account obviously and waited. After 10 minutes of no notification, here are the results:

As you can see from the [image ](https://i.imgur.com/VN1ruSY.png) Gmail (aka [bigtop](https://www.androidpolice.com/2014/10/21/rumor-a-project-codenamed-bigtop-will-be-googles-new-task-oriented-email-system/) ) sends a push notification, on time, at 8:13, exactly when it arrived in my mailbox. However, something within Android, maybe GMS does not, for the lack of a better term, acknowledge it. Another arrives 30 seconds later. The system again ignores it.

As soon as I unlock the phone, the alert arrives saying 10 mins. So I look at the logs and as you can see at 08:24 it did a pull and shows the notification.

So I tested again and sent an email at 10:09 and waited. After 6 minutes of no notification, I run another [FCM diagnostic](https://i.imgur.com/v069NpG.png)

Push notification arrives on time and the notification system ignores it and doesn't show the notification. But when I unlock the phone, the phone does a GMS pull and shows the notification.

So, to everyone thinking that this is a battery optimization issue, this is evidence that it is not. The bugs are not in the apps. The bug is in the OS/FCM/GMS or whatever.

To run the same diagnostic, go to your phone app and dial 

    *#*#426#*#*

Send yourself test emails and share the results.

edit: And it's on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/phetherweyt/status/1192793917881823233?s=0) too if you're into that sort of thing:

edit 2: For fun - If you have the Reddit App, notifications work through GMS as well. As soon as they are received, the phone displays and sends an Ack message back.",0
"A more complete shortcut for ""Hey Google, I'm being pulled over"" for Android devices First I want to give credit to the earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/haraqv/hey_google_im_being_pulled_over/) and all that's been said there as well as the original creator of that tutorial.

This tutorial below will create a more complete shortcut that will do the following:

1. Send a text message to your designated contacts with a message and your current GPS location via Google Maps link
2. Record video while the phone is locked
3. Upload the recorded videos automatically to Google Drive or other cloud service
4. Share the cloud folder of recorded videos with your designated contacts
5. Run all this while the phone is in [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) mode

&amp;#x200B;

**The basic function is to allow you to record video while the phone is in** [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) **mode. This has obvious benefits over a screen with brightness set to 0.** This will provide more robust function than the similar iOS shortcut ""I'm being pulled over"" which also just sets the screen brightness to 0.

&amp;#x200B;

Apps you will need:

1. [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;hl=en_CA)
2. [Quick Video Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kimcy929.secretvideorecorder&amp;hl=en_CA)
3. [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en_CA) or [Automate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llamalab.automate&amp;hl=en_CA) (there should be other apps that can work as well)
4. Cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc)
5. [Cloud auto sync app](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=autosync&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en_CA)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1**: Make sure [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) mode is enabled on your phone

Open your phones Settings app, navigate to the **Security &amp; Location** option. Tap **Lock Screen Preferences** and toggle on **Show Lockdown Option** from the list.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2**: Configure Quick Video Recorder

* In Settings, you have plenty of customization on how you want the app to work. Most importantly, make sure to disable battery optimizations and to set a recording time/size limit. This allows the app to automatically end recordings so the files can be uploaded automatically. You can also allow recordings to repeat automatically if you need video recording for longer.
* Toggle ""Enable Do Not Disturb while recording"" to On
* Scroll down in Settings to Shortcut Settings, and create a Front Camera Shortcut or Back Camera Shortcut or both. This will put an Activity shortcut on your homescreen. If it doesn't, you will need to dig through Nova Launcher gestures to confirm the shortcut is created.
* Click on the shortcut to test the app works.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3**: Configure your cloud service to auto sync the video folder

* By default your videos will be recorded to the folder QuickVideoRecorder
* Follow the instructions of the cloud sync app to auto sync this folder. It would be better to enable the option to detect new files automatically and upload them
* Make sure to enable the app to auto sync over mobile data and while the phone is plugged in and on battery. This should not cause much battery drain if at all since it will only upload files if there's a new file added to the folder. 
* If there's any paid limitations like file size, consider paying to remove those limitations or finding a free app to do the same sync function

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4**: Share your cloud folder with your designated contacts

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 5**: Configure your automation app

Now this part gets tricky depending on which you want to use. I will use Tasker as an example, but I'm sure that this can be done with Automate and other apps as well.

1. Open Tasker, go to Tasks tab, create new Task
2. Add Shortcut (+ Button &gt; App &gt; Shortcut) &gt; press the magnifying glass icon next to Shortcut &gt; Nova Launcher: Activities &gt; Quick Video Recorder &gt; Front camera shortcut. Save the task with label if needed
3. Add Location parse (+ button &gt; Location &gt; Get Location v2). Back out to Task Edit
4. Add Send SMS (+ button &gt; Phone &gt; Send SMS)
   1. Number: Use magnifying glass icon at Number to find your designated contacts
   2. Message: I'm being pulled over %gl\_map\_url   or some other message with  %gl\_map\_url at the end
   3. Add label if needed, and go back to Task Edit
5. Add System Lock (+ Button &gt; Display &gt; System Lock)
6. Press the Play button on the bottom left to test your task. If everything works, your phone should execute each of these tasks in sequence. Make sure to enable permissions as needed
7. Select an icon for your task by clicking the icon with multiple boxes next to the + button
8. Create an app out of the task you just created:
   1. Back to Tasker home screen, find the task you created in Tasks tab
   2. Press and hold the task
   3. Expand the context menu and Export &gt; As App
   4. You will be asked to download [Tasker App Factory](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory&amp;hl=en_CA)
   5. In Package section, enter a random sequence of letters with a . in between (ie: oisjf.sidfwei)
   6. Install the app by allowing Tasker the necessary permissions as well as allowing the app to be installed and bypass Google Play protection. This is safe since you are making your own app
9. You will find a new app installed on your phone with the same name as your task
10. Test the new app. The first time you will need to enable a bunch of permissions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 6**: Integrate into Google Assistant

\*Note there may be limitations depending on if your Android device allows you to trigger Google Assistant while the phone is locked. This step is therefore optional and you can just use the newly created Tasker app manually.

1. Open Google Assistant settings from Settings app or by asking ""Ok Google, open Google Assistant settings"" and open your profile icon on top right
2. Open Assistant tab
3. Scroll down to Routines
4. Add a routine
5. Under ""Add commands"", add your trigger phrase ""I'm being pulled over"" or whatever you want your phrase to be
6. Press + Add action
7. Under Enter command, type in Open -name of your Tasker app-  (ie: Open Pulled Over)
8. Save
9. Make sure that your Google Assistant can be triggered while your phone is locked. Here's a link to instructions on how to do this. [Link](https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/439605?hl=en)

**Done**

&amp;#x200B;

If Google Assistant is not working well or your phone does not support Google Assistant triggering or some other limitation, consider a simple Nova Launcher gesture shortcut to activate your Tasker app or shortcut that records video and puts phone in Lockdown mode. For example, two finger swipe up to turn on Front Camera Shortcut activity and two finger swipe down to Screen Lock (make sure to give Nova Launcher admin permissions to use Screen Lock shortcut).

&amp;#x200B;

**Important**: As mentioned above, the confusing Tasker bit and implementing with Google Assistant is very much optional. It's here to create a seamless flow of events triggered by your voice. But if your Android phone has weird integration with Google Assistant or it won't trigger while locked, it could get annoying. You'll also need to unlock your device for Google Assistant to trigger an app, requiring you to have an easily accessible fingerprint scanner or face unlock.

**Remember, reliability is key.** If it doesn't reliably work, you're better off using the Front Camera Shortcut/Back Camera Shortcut directly and then putting your phone in Lockdown mode. Or using the Nova Launcher gestures example above.

There's more actions you can add to this as well, such as turning off music, sending periodic GPS location pings, etc. If you're rooted there's probably a whole bunch of crazy things you can do. Tinker at will.

&amp;#x200B;

The process is more complicated than a simple Google Assistant routine but this is probably the most feature rich implementation of this idea. Keep in mind there are obvious limitations to this shortcut such as your phone runs out of battery, the SIM card is removed, etc.

As far as installation it is possible to simply export the Tasker task APK and allow people to install it. For the sake of being as trustless as possible, I hope you will make your own apps instead.

I created this separate post because I didn't want all this to get buried in the comments section. It's also a bit long to dig through as a comment post.

"A tool to help with rooting and updating of Android devices! I've just finished building a small tool called [symbit](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit) which helps with rooting and updating of existing rooted devices. With Android 10, some TWRP versions have not been updated to support the new /system partition format and do not work for those devices. This tool aims to solve the issue by making it easier to root and update existing rooted Android devices.

[Source code](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit)

[README](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/blob/master/README.md)

[Download Links](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit#install)

My original motivation to create this was when my friend asked me for help updating his Pixel 3 XL. Due to the fact that TWRP does not support Android 10 on the Pixel, I had to tell him to use the manual updating method which involved typing many commands to update the system and patching the boot.img file via Magisk. I decided then to create this small utility to help him and (hopefully) someone else who may have difficulties rooting/updating their rooted device.

In future when I (hopefully) have more time to work on this, it will support running without a PC and directly on Android itself through termux.

"/r/Android's opinions of device manufacturers over time **RESULTS**

[Dark theme](https://imgur.com/0GdSiDY)

[Light/colourblind](https://imgur.com/4Z47bP5)

&amp;#x200B;

**METHOD**

I've been learning about natural language processing over the last couple of months, and thought this would be fun project.

I trained a convolutional neural network on sentiment analysis using Amazon reviews from the ""Cell Phones and Accessories"" category. The mean score of these reviews was \~4.2, so I chose to mark scores &gt;= 4 as positive and &lt; 4 as negative. I then trained the neural network on these reviews, until it could consistently predict what a good (4 or 5 star) or a bad (1, 2 or 3 star) review looked like, just given the review's text.

The trained model will produce a value near to 1 given the text of a positive review and 0 given a negative review. Once it was trained on the Amazon reviews, I applied it to reddit comments.


To reduce the number of comments that I would need to test on, I only downloaded comments which contained one or more of the manufacturer's names. This has the downside of eliminating comments that didn't explicitly mention a brand even if it was obviously referenced (""Samsung Galaxy S8"" vs ""Galaxy S8""). This also is a problem if a comment contains more than one name eg

&gt;I hate how iOS is so restricted. I wish Apple would allow us to set default apps, like Google.

In this case, the low sentiment score would be added to both Apple and Google's results, even though Google wasn't the target of the comment's negativity.


Each plotted point is the week's average. I don't think the results are accurate [given how noisy the raw data was](https://imgur.com/i7lliLF) and the [varying amounts of data for each OEM](https://imgur.com/SDP0R8N), but overall trends are consistent with my own predictions.

It's often suggested that Apple is liked more than any other manufacturer on /r/Android, and that does seem to be the case -- the iPhone 11 launch is the greatest maximum point on the graph, though I was expecting more of a drop with the iPhone 7. Samsung's stagnating line was a surprise and may be due to the high prices of recent flagships. Somewhat predictably, the sub's perception of Google is the only one heading consistently downhill given the poor reaction to the Pixel line and other Google products.

I also collected data for Huawei, HTC and Xiaomi but didn't include them in the main results as the number of comments for each seemed too small for a fair comparison. [Here is the graph with them included](https://imgur.com/54dTkN5).  


Again, these findings shouldn't be taken seriously as I'm not using a state-of-the-art model and the comment selection process was as basic as it could get, but hopefully it was interesting for some of you.

A fresh clean look and the organisation of a lot of UI's are what make for that aesthetically pleasing look on a phone. And on top of that you get the physical design and clean look on that same device. Idk about you guys I personally find the look of a lot of Huawei, Oppo, Samsung and Xiaomi phones eye-catching. And when you get a clean looking OS with a beautiful stock background it's just beautiful, that's why I never changed the background on my S10+. Stock backgrounds always tend to be my favourite part of the phone. Nonetheless, Android really is outdoing themselves with the look of their operating system with each version, at least to me.",0
"[Opinion] Reviewers place way too much weight on the camera when reviewing phones Something I've noticed as the reviews for the Pixel 4 have started to come in is that a very large portion of most reviews is spent talking about the camera. This seems very strange to me, at this point pretty much all high end phone cameras are good to very good and I think most people don't really care if their phone cameras are 1% closer to DSLR quality than their competitor. 

I think this comes down to most reviewers being way more into photography and videography than the average person(especially youtube reviewers). I'd much rather have them spend more time talking about battery life or UI changes than colour balance or lens angles.

"Long term Galaxy Tab S6 review: The best Android tablet that is awfully underrated Last year, I was in the market for a new tablet. Since I was already in the Android/Samsung ecosystem, and my girlfriend already has the iPad Pro, I took the bullet and bought the Galaxy Tab S6. Here is my in-depth review after using it for about 8 months:

# Display

This is the highlight of this device. I will say it: The **Galaxy Tab S6 has the best looking \~10"" display you can get on any device today**. It's vivid, contrasty, bright, and has excellent viewing angles. The main advantage is the fact that it's a large version of the AMOLED panel used on Samsung's flagship phones. I have the new MacBook Pro 13"", iPad Pro and a Galaxy S10 to compare, and I can't think of a better device to watch movies or play games than the Tab S6. It doesn't have the 120hz refresh rate of the iPad Pro, but for my use case of watching Netflix, reading eBooks, and playing some popular games (CoD Mobile, PUBG, Asphalt), all of which fall under 60fps, this 60hz AMOLED display wins over a 120hz LCD display. For more latency-sensitive use like drawing, and playing certain games, then the iPad Pro has an advantage. Worth mentioning that the Tab S7 that's right around the corner, will likely have 120hz support as well.

# Speaker

The Tab S6 comes with a quad-speaker set up. It's loud, clear, and balanced. It's better than my (gf's) iPad Pro (2019) and almost as good as my MacBook Pro 13 speaker (which is regarded as having one of the best speakers for a laptop). Listening to music, watching movies or gaming is quite enjoyable on these. The speaker also seems to change its audio profile/direction depending on your screen rotation dynamically.

# Design

The design is premium and sturdy. The design on the Tab S6 is as good as it can get for a modern tablet. I do wish they had an IP rating, but that's something the iPad Pro also lacks. The S-Pen sticks to the back of the tablet. At first, I thought this was weird, especially if you are going to lay down your tablet flat. However, pretty much any case which would flatten the bump and makes it look like the S-Pen is in a tiny hidden pocket. I think some even might prefer this over the iPad Pro approach (which adds extra width).

# Battery

The battery lasts all day of continuous usage. Standby time has been pretty good for me as well, even after leaving it on standby for some days. Overall, I have no complaints in this department.

# Performance

This is one of the smoothest/fastest devices I've used, even after 8 months. The old days of Samsung's laggy software are long gone. The Tab S6 handles everything you throw at it with a breeze. Games, multi-tasking, and just general usage are lag-free and fast. It comes with the latest UFS 3.0 storage which is an upgrade over the UFS 2.1 on the S10. One UI 2 update even brought some nice animations changes. 

# Software

You would think Samsung would slap on their One UI that's on their phones and be done with it, but Samsung did add small but noticeable tablet-specific optimizations and features here and there. The S-Pen and Samsung Dex integration are well done. You can use Samsung Dex straight from your tablet without having to use a second monitor, which is pretty cool. I also really like the new gesture system on One UI 2.1. I no longer have to reach all the way to the bottom just to go back. Overall, I like the software. The system layouts are pretty intuitive and optimized for a tablet. Speaking of layouts...

# App scaling

I've been pretty surprised by how well Android apps work on devices with varying screen sizes. I can't think of any app where I thought the layout was bothering me. I guess if Android apps work well on ChromeOS, foldables, and Samsung Dex, they should work fine on a tablet.

Some Google apps like YouTube, many Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and My Files have some tablet optimizations. By tablet optimizations, I mean letting you see a bit more content at once. I think they are a nice touch, but I don't think they are an absolute necessity on Android since Android already handles app scaling pretty well.

Apps without tablet optimizations work way better than they do on an iPad. Instagram, for example, has massive letterboxing on an iPad. [Whereas on an Android, it's full screen.](https://mobile.twitter.com/daniel_scuteri/status/1265102390782382080) Some might argue Android is just ""enlarging"" the app, but I would say most people would prefer that over a miniature version of the app. Plus, most Android apps make use of the larger screen real estate by displaying more content (for example, more songs on Spotify and more emails at once on Tab S6 vs. S20).

# S-Pen

These are just bigger versions of the S-Pen on the Note series, which are pretty good. Compared to the iPad Pro, the latency could be better, but that's more of a display refresh rate issue.

The biggest problem is the lack of apps that make use of the pen. Some apps like Dropbox Paper have excellent iPad pencil support but no Android pen support. I've found Samsung Notes to be the best at note-taking when it comes to the S-Pen support. Hopefully, more widespread adoption of the Galaxy Note/Fold 2 series will help drive more S-Pen support in apps.

# Main gripes

* Slow updates. I got the Android 10 One UI 2 update a month ago, May 2020. That's pretty late to the party. Some parts of the world got it months earlier but the US got it last. The One UI 2 on S10 was released late Nov 2019, which makes you wonder why it took so long. Security updates are also slow. I get security updates every three months, but my S10 gets them monthly? I am not sure why there's a vast discrepancy in update speed between Samsung's devices. Likely the issue is a mix of long QA testing, limited resources, and carriers taking their time.
* Fingerprint scanner. In the past, the FP scanner had 60% success rate. Nowadays, on the newer version of the software, I think it's pretty good at a \~85% success rate. Still could be better, but these optical fp scanners are surprisingly more accurate to wet, sweaty fingers than the old capacitive fp scanners.
* Camera. It's acceptable. It's a single 12MP camera that is not as good as the S10's camera. I've tried GCAM ports on it, and they do seem to improve picture quality. Tablets have always had weaker cameras than phones, and this is not an exception.
* Poor thermal management when charging. If I'm playing a graphically intensive game while charging, the frame-rate drops 10 minutes in. My S10 does not do this, even though they have the same SoC, and the tablet has a larger surface area for heat dissipation. I guess that the Tab S6 lacks the liquid cooling of the S10 and/or the system doesn't correctly slow its charging speed under load.

# Final thoughts

The Tab S6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. Every time I use this device, I can't help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. A lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. The Tab S6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best Android tablet, or the best 10"" entertainment device, I think this tablet should be #1 on your list.

"So you like Nova. What does it has that others can't match yet? To me, it's icons. I always try a lot of different launchers, but every single time I end coming back to Nova thanks to the way it treats icons. This launcher has its way to get them *right*, 90% of the time: the adaptative icons look as they were meant to be round for some reason, the normalization keeps every ones size in check, the grid configuration allows me to pack the with just the right density, and having a  [""floaty"" dock](https://i.imgur.com/CTIPcDO.jpg) makes all look even better.

"So.. I bought this new Xiaomi phone, (MIUI) and found out some horrible practices that many android-users should be made aware of. Hi all. I'm sorry if you already knew this, but I would love to inform some android users about practices by Xiaomi and probably many others.

So I bought this new Xiaomi Note 8 Pro about 1 month ago. I've been hesitant to swap my sim-card to this new phone, since I kinda wanted to keep it ""clean"", and remove all bloatware before I use it. I didn't want it to get linked to me personally, so I also created a new google account etc.

Now I know what you're thinking... it doesn't change a thing. And you're right, it doesn't. 
But I'm not here to talk about googles practices (which are equally shady..) but about Xiaomi's.

The problem is that there are default installed apps that cannot be removed that are linked to Xiaomi. I tracked the wifi-traffic and noticed that over a dozen apps or services try to communicate my data to servers of Xiaomi, Amazon, Facebook and Alibaba. (and more). There was no facebook installed, no amazon app, this was a clean phone. 

So I went to my computer and via USB disabled a bunch of default apps that were obviously there to track... Default contacts, messages, Gmail, even the Gallery app is there to send your shit to xiaomi and others.. .
The calculator requires access to your phonecalls,sdcard,.. , your calendar wants wifi, messages,... It's all just rigged.

Now I've been obsessing over these issues lately, and I dug a little deeper. What I just found out, and it may not come as a shock, is that EVERYTHING YOU DO on this phone, even with wifi turned off, is stored in log-files, ready to be sent to the ""mi cloudservice"". By almost 20 Different services that are running on your phone, and you can't disable it. There's this security app that has access to every part of your phone, and it can reset your ""custom"" settings for certain apps. So if you disable access to contacts for your calculator... ""security app"" by xiaomi has the rights to just undo your changes.

It's horrible...

I spent a lot (subjective..) on a pretty ass phone, but I feel sick using it and just transmitting my data every time it connects to the wifi. It tracks the SIM Card I put in it, logs that my ""SIM_STATUS_CHANGED"", with a personalized ID, so they can just start tracking with that ID. I'm sorry for the rant, but I feel like new potential clients should know this stuff before they buy it.

There is no way out. If you disable too many services, your phone starts to work against you. I get popups from ""Google play service"" that says I have to enable all their access requests, or my mobile game won't work"". spoiler.. the game just works. it's just that they know you disabled them in a certain way, and want you to think you NEED to allow them access. 


Again... Sorry for the rant, but I'm utterly disgusted. I live in west-europe and I'm being apparantly tracked by 5 huge companies by just owning a stupid ass phone, and I can't turn that shit off.


There will be people saying ""what do you have to hide"", but they just don't know that invading privacy is just a huge step in the wrong direction for all of humanity.

For those who have nothing to hide I suggest checking this video and maybe more from his channel. ""The hated one"" ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjspu7QV7O0





Edit; I was wrong about many things and am happy I learned from people who knew what they're talking about. Fact remains that many services are logging and sending data without me knowing, and they can't be removed on stock miui. I don't want my phone to talk to anyone if I don't give that permission, and it does it anyway. Google is installing/updating without my permission, even when ""auto update apps"" is turned off. gps data is gathered in a log file, even with gps turned off. Gallery is linked to mi cloud and normal users would never know. by using your phone you accept your data to be sent to xiaomi &amp; others. and I find that unacceptable.",0

"Did OnePlus keep their promise? OnePlus 6T's history of security patches and OTA's. Hi everyone,

over the last \~500 days, I used a script on my OnePlus 6T, which documented information like the current security patch of my phone, and the time that has passed since the last OTA update.

I did this in order to check how well OnePlus is doing with (security) updates, especially with regard to their ""OnePlus Software Maintenance Schedule"" ([https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/)). And now that I have all the data, I thought I might as well share it with you.

At first, I made a plot, which shows the age of the security patch over time (starting from April 9th, 2019, half a year after launch): https://imgur.com/hBNTqtx.

* On those days that have a green star, the security patch was very recent (&lt;= 30 days, which is the ways it should be).
* Orange points have a patch that is between 31 and 60 days old,
* the red points are between 61 and 90 days,
* and for the purple points, the security patch is older than 90 days!

**On average, the security patch on the OnePlus 6T was 58 days old**. For comparison, a phone that always gets the latest patch at the beginning of each month (i.e. a Pixel phone), would have an average of \~15 days, and a phone that gets patched at the beginning of each second month would have an average of \~30 days.

I also took a look at the time between new versions of OxygenOS and found that **on average OnePlus updated the OnePlus 6T every** **~~35~~** **41 days. The fastest update was after 18 days and the longest update took 73 days.** (I could also make a plot if you want, but I think that this is less interesting).

Thus, in summary we can say that while OnePlus kept their promise to deliver bimonthly updates, these updates did not always include the most recent security patch.

Finally, it took OnePlus **25 days to upgrade the 6T from Android 9 to Android 10** and the **Linux kernel on the 6T was upgraded only once in all of this time.** Currently, the kernel is 54 revisions behind.

I hope that this data is interesting for some of you.

PS: I also managed to run my script on a Nokia phone with Android One. Once I have enough data for this phone, I might update this post. In general, it would also be nice to compare this data with the one from other manufactures.

\[EDIT\] The 6T launched at the beginning of November 2018, but I only I started logging the data on April 9th, 2019, i.e. half a year after the release of the phone.

\[EDIT\] Here is the code, in case you want to run the macro/script on your own device: [https://github.com/skumblex/android-patch-logger](https://github.com/skumblex/android-patch-logger). I hope that the device properties that I used are available on all device. If this is not the case, please let me know.

"Which Reddit app do you use and why? (2020 edition) Bringing this back because the last post I saw on this topic was in 2017, which I think could be considered a little outdated. 

I switched to Android around the start of the year and I've been loving it; the customization, the features, the fact that it's not made by Apple, etc. One problem though: I can't find a Reddit app that suits me. I'm sure you know of the various stability and user experience issues that come with the official Reddit app, so I prefer to use alternatives.
 On IOS, I used Apollo for its simple, intuitive, and user-friendly design. It felt primarily focused on casual browsing and posting, and that suited me. But Apollo isn't on Android, so I ended up using Sync instead, after reading approximately one article on it.

Sync is... fine, it works, but it doesn't quite work for me. I'm not saying its bad, it just doesn't suit how I use Reddit. So I'd like you to share what version of Reddit you prefer and why.

I'm not the author, i just really like this program, so i found as much about it as i could, and i started contributing to it because i've been trying other ""free"" and paid solutions before for my parents and it didn't really work out. Then i saw Baldphone on some subreddit post, it is Open-source, i like that it has built-in updater, simple gallery, i hope it gets good community support and development.

**PS**. If i find more useful info on it, i will add it to the post. Last updated: 22.5.2020",0

"Hey Google, stop using me as a lab rat for your dark mode A/B testing Rant incoming:

Two weeks ago I was delighted to find that my Google app has finally joined the dark mode club. The joy didn't last long though: After two days dark mode was gone again, so I went ahead and installed the latest beta. First it was still glaring white, but after a day or so I was back on the dark side. This lasted for about one and a half weeks. Today I woke up with a glaring white Google app again.

Seriously Google, how is that considered good user experience?

The same happened with Play Store, I had dark more for like 2 days only for it to vanish again.

I get the concept of A/B testing, but what Google is doing is excessive. A/B testing should be giving one group of users a feature, test it, roll it out to the next group, etc. and not ""give group A feature X, take it away, reintroduce it, take it away again and bring it back again"".

Stop using me as a lab rat for your A/B testing shenanigans, Google! This whole mess is really driving me towards ditching Google apps altogether.",0

"OnePlus has turned OxygenOS into an advertising machine. Why is no one calling them out? There was a recent thread calling out Samsung for pushing ads via notification - https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/hdaf59/samsung_pushing_ads_in_notifications_even_though/  

But nobody seems to be calling out OnePlus for turning their OS into a advertisement machine. Everytime I enter settings I have a huge unremovable card with a red dot blaring at me. 

I don't give a shit about their red cable nonsense and I didn't pay for a phone to be infested with ads in its settings app.  
  

Here's a screenshot for reference - 

https://imgur.com/a/6ZgM9mB  
   
   


EDIT 1 - For everyone telling me it's merely a login service. IT'S NOT. It's an ad infested bloatware that is being masked as an account login service. Once you login, the cards start displaying red dots indicating a new notification. It's an entire advertisement centre once you tap on the card. I should have posted a second picture for clarity.

After OnePlus 8 was launched, they heavily advertised the phones, bullets etc. In this advertisement centre.

"the problem with youtube tech reviewers hi i don't really know how to structure this but i had this on my mind for a very long time here we go:

1: (the reviews are shallow) i just finished watching mkbhd's video on the s20 ultra(just using him as an example these things apply to most other popular creators). i found his review extremely shallow even though the review is almost 20 minutes.(almost all his reviews are like this)  he only went through points which most people knew about, the first 5 minutes was just fluff and d brand sponsorship 

2: (the lack of criticism) the s20 ultra cost $1,400, instead of challenging why this phone cost so much, all mkbhd says this has all the specs, but that doesn't justify such a huge price increase, samsung is charging so much yet the phone will only get 2 year software support, this phone such a bad value for money yet  that does not factor into the review 

they don't purchase the phone with there own money, which can completely change the way you  view a product( i don't expect them to start buying phones, but i do expect these biases to be taken in consideration when doing reviews

all the tech youtubers are afraid to criticise tech companies because if they do they wont receive review units in the future(they will throw a little jab here and there that's it)

3:(style over substance) the production quality is so so high yet the actual review is dogshit, mkbhd has being saying for years how he is going to improves his reviews, the only thing that improved is the gear he uses over the years, the actual reviews have stayed the same 

4: this guy just proves that youtubers don't know what they are taling about  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtd7UzLJHrU&amp;t=218s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtd7UzLJHrU&amp;t=218s) 

tldr: youtubers are just glorified marketers for the companies

Edit: some people seem to think youtubers cant be criticised just because ""we are not the target audience"" what you people dont realise is that these reviewes affect us all.


These tech reviewers have a big impact on the industry. For example about 6 yeara ago every single youtuber criticised samsung just because they used plastic back, (which allowed for a removable battery) . And now we have phones with no removable battry and phones made from glass(which is apparently quality)",0

"Other things manufacturers and reviewers fail to tell you ‚Äì the state of Bluetooth audio in mobile phones is still shameful and even with the latest flagships you might not be able to reach by default good/very good quality in most conditions Some time ago we [talked how Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x/5.x is not equal in various flagships (Apple included)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ak2tqq/what_is_really_wrong_with_bluetooth_5_how_the/) and also [how with some of the most expensive flagships GPS/GNSS also might be a bigger compromise than you would expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/amob8i/last_weekend_we_talked_about_how_not_all_ble_5/).

The issue for this post is Bluetooth Audio and how things on this front are far from great especially in Android. Many people already know something is not right since they always run into issues with skipping sound and bad noise or bad sound in their headphones ‚Äì but to learn why that takes place and how you can avoid/improve this you will need to read to the end of this AND DO YOUR OWN TESTS YOURSELF (also that type of problems might take place even when you are OK with less than good/excellent audio compression, so it might still be worth reading anyway).

The subject of what is wrong with Bluetooth in general and audio in special is so long that can‚Äôt be covered fully in just a few paragraphs, but generally you might be having quality problems or transmission problems ‚Äì if quality is not that much of an issue just skim over first part below and go to the transmission issues in the 2nd part.

Let‚Äôs first define what I am calling here good quality headphone audio ‚Äì you don‚Äôt really need well-over-1000 buckaroos (name which I will use as a reference for USD in US and EUR in Europe) reference studio headphones to get good quality (you can get exceptional quality if money is no object but that is not the topic here), you can in fact get good quality starting slightly below 100 buckaroos with some good WIRED headphones. So you would expect that if you buy a wireless model that is 3-4 times more expensive you will be able to enjoy at all times about the same good audio quality ‚Äì unfortunately you are definitely wrong about the ‚Äúat all times‚Äù part and that might be in fact close to never by default (unless you really optimize your setup).

One quick observation ‚Äì if you want to investigate audio quality the only ultra-reliable way is with special measuring device, but you can still get some decent results with your own ears (or somebody else‚Äôs ‚Äúgolden ears‚Äù) as long as you test properly (if your input sound is some 128 kbps MP3 or some internet streaming service you are doing it wrong, you need FLAC or other lossless sources to test properly). Your best results will come if you test comparatively almost side-by-side (or at least if you can change settings ‚Äúon the fly‚Äù and you focus on how the sound changes). It is also important to know what types of the sound are most sensitive for instance to compression settings ‚Äì in my experience classical music with a mix of string and brass instruments tends to show much easier differences in compression settings as a result of their much higher harmonics (if I would have to pick a single piece for testing I would pick Beethoven‚Äôs 5th in the Gardiner version with a strong accent on the finale). Most of my very recent tests have been done on Sony MDR1000X and Sony WH1000XM3 which also have their own set of quirks ‚Äì in fact the older MDR1000X which are ‚Äúmark 1‚Äù have a cleaner sound than the newer ‚Äúmark 3‚Äù and both sound MUCH better for absolute sound quality in a quiet room with noise cancelling disabled (and powered-on even on wired tests ‚Äì impedance it around 47ohm like that vs around 16ohm when non-powered); however 1000XM3 are a huge lot better on noise cancelling so for travel are vastly superior.

I will direct people that are newer to the topic of Bluetooth codecs to an article like this - https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/ - but to simplify things for the rest of this we will have to agree that you can‚Äôt have good quality beyond a certain compression level and most people (myself included) would generally consider good to very good only (optimally) compressed streams above 500 kbps, with the streams in the 250-350 kbps being rather in the range of acceptable than good to very good. People might complain that 250-320 kbps is perfectly good for them (that could be mostly the Apple people where AAC only goes as far as 250-320 kbps) and of course (and as you can see in the link provided and many other on the internet) there will be people that will consider the 500 kbps not enough and some will fault even 900+ kbps - but for the moment let‚Äôs go forward with this convention/compromise ‚Äì since you might encounter problems even with that, or even with lower values and bigger compromises ‚Äì and that has something to do with hardware and especially low-level driver limitations even in the most expensive flagships from the last few years. Again ‚Äì properly testing that will not be easy. Also keep in mind that by default in no phone that I tested so far the highest quality is activated by default (something the article also mentioned) and in no phone that I tested so far you can make the highest-quality settings stick ‚Äì so basically each time you connect your headphones you must go in developer options (which you must first enable in Android) and force the LDAC quality to the highest value. Go there and try changing quality while you listen to your favorite audio testing piece ‚Äì on many phones you will instantly hear a difference (on some other phones you might need to stop the player and start again). DO YOUR OWN TESTS!

Do we have enough bandwidth for good audio? Bluetooth EDR has up to 3 Mbps but even under perfect conditions the limits for packet sending and receiving means that at the absolute most you can only reach around 2 Mbps, which would sound as perfectly acceptable. But the issue here is not the absolute bandwidth value but instead the EFFECTIVE BANDWIDTH available in specific conditions (that happen to be normal conditions for many/most people) ‚Äì and here we must quickly talk about 2.4GHz radio coexistence, most notably WiFi + Bluetooth coexistence ‚Äì and to get a quick start on that you can look at the main image from this page:

https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/200794267-Will-wireless-interference-and-Wi-Fi-impact-beacons-

where you will see that WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth are literally sharing the same radio bands where signals can‚Äôt really work well at the absolute same time for both (things are in fact even worse than the image since many if not most of the modern 2.4GHz WiFi access points can also use double-width channels where a single AP will in fact take over almost twice of the spectrum shown in the picture above). If you add widespread situations in populated areas like [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/LyjisTD.png) you can easily understand that radio quality can be quite a mess. You might also need to add to this mess the fact that for instance ‚Äútrue wireless‚Äù earbuds have tiny antennas and yet use about twice the radio bandwidth of normal headphones for the same quality (since you have one connection from your phone to one of the buds and then most often a separate connection from the first to the 2nd bud).

But this is not the entire mess or the worst part of it ‚Äì the worst part of it comes since on the phone itself there is usually a hardware-level or low-level-driver level exclusion mechanism between WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth ‚Äì so when both are active at the same time packets being sent over Bluetooth very frequently need to wait for WiFi activity to get to a well-defined state before being sent, and depending on how that is implemented the amount of waiting quickly becomes too long and you start losing packets and hearing ‚Äúcracks‚Äù in the sound. The issue is obviously taking place less often (and somehow at a more apparently random times) on lower quality settings so if you want quickly to check that the issue is present you just need to connect some headphones on LDAC or aptxHD and crank-up quality to the maximum. You can accelerate that even more by running at the same time a bandwidth test on the 2.4GHz WiFi from the phone ‚Äì I run https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest  on a local wired server on my local network and I normally get around 80 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band on most phones, but when I listen from the same phone with highest LDAC quality the WiFi speedtest collapses to 10 Mbps and most often at the same time you get to hear some skipping or cracking! Funny is that on the most recents Pixel2XL drivers+Android the speed collapses to just about 2 Mbps but there is no cracking (it was absolutely there one year or so ago), which suggests they finally got the priority order right.

**Either way in my experience the best way to minimize the issues with Bluetooth Audio skipping is to either disable completely WiFi or force a connection on a 5GHz Access Point - again DO YOUR OWN TESTS! There might still be one source of WiFi and Bluetooth interferences on Android while playing BT audio ‚Äì and that is special WiFi and Bluetooth scanning as ‚Äúlocation helper‚Äù - disable those as part of your tests and see if you get any difference. Also as a completely separate test (probably more important on ‚Äútrue wireless buds‚Äù) - try to see if there is any difference keeping your phone on your left vs right pocket ‚Äì you might sometimes be surprised of what you will find.**

**EDIT:**

IMHO one other immediate improvement that Google **could** and **should** do with Android 11 is to use SBC standard codec in a better way as already the guys from LineageOS are doing:

"Just taken Delivery of the CAT S52, can try and answer any questions. I have been using the CAT S41 for over 2 years so am used to midrange CAT phones. 

My main reason for getting the S52 is due to bluetooth issues that developed on my S41( could be software, could be aging hardware but its annoying).

Current worries are battery life going from 5000mAh to 3100mAh. I was worried about the screen but even with a much lower ppi density the colours and image quality seem to be far better then the S41 I guess that's due to moving away from TFT. 

Headphone and charging port do not have covers like the S41 which after 2 years I don't trust mine anymore.

"Announced 8.5 mths ago, released 2 mths ago, and Google Buds v2 are still only in 1 country and 1 color Firstly I know COVID is a thing. But it wasn't a thing for the entire 3.5+ years since the first version. And Apple and Samsung have both launched multiple products over the last few months without significant issues.

Google clearly has a problem shipping products and I'd be interested to know why this never seems to improve. I don't know how they expect to gain market share by consistently releasing things that are mildly over-priced, and unavailable to most of the world. You can't catch up by going slower than everyone else.

It's not like this is their first swing at this. They've been shipping a huge variety of products for half a decade, and still don't seem to have this ironed out. 

It doesn't make any sense. Why do they keep spending all this time, money, and engineering effort building something and then knee-cap it on launch. It's like they want it to exist, but don't seem to care at all if it's successful.

They have all the resources in the world to make this successful if they wanted to. They own the software, the hardware, and all of the services, and even the datacenters that the services run on. They have some of the best engineers in the world, they have been building their own servers and other hardware for a decade. They hold all the cards, and still do basically nothing.",0

E-waste is a huge issue. Financially, it makes sense to keep a phone for more years.

OEMs do not sell batteries or other components or force them not to be sold,ala apple. This is an absolute crime in regards to consumer rights and the environment.

Furthermore, OEMs create devices, like the S10 or LG thinq whatever version, with glued in batteries and soldered usb-c ports.

Oh, you wanna change the battery? It might explode and is glued in!

Oh you wanna change the usbc port? Its soldered to the motherboard. So you have to change the Motherboard too!

This is absolutely insane.

The way things are now. This cannot go on. 


Secondly, the same should hold true for software. If software is unsupported, it should at least be rootable ane bootloaders should be unlockable.

And none if that apple based planned obsolescence where they intentionality slow devices to ""help"" eith the battery. Thats just pathetic. Give me the option to buy a new battery and replace it myself.

"Unpopular opinion: 3-button navigation is just flat out easier to use than gestures and is also quintessential Android About a week ago I decided to switch back to 3-button navigation just to see how much different it was now compared to the gesture navigation that I've gotten used to on my Pixel 3.

To my surprise, I found that it was just way easier to use. Going Home was faster, swiping the slideout menus were easier and less error prone, double tap to flip apps was super quick, accessing the Assistant made more sense. It just all worked.

Not only that but it really just feels like a signature part of Android. If you see someone with the three icons at the bottom of the screen, you instantly know they're an Android user. And if they're filled in, you further instantly know they're a Pixel user.

I'm glad that they brought back the option to use 3-button Nav in Android 10, but I'm worried that it's only a temporary option and it'll be gone in Android 11 or 12. The new ""smaller"" Assistant is only available in gesture nav, and it makes me think what else they'll remove if you're using the 3-button Nav. They already removed the hold-to-split action on the overview button, which was super useful for multi-tasking.",0

"A family walks into AT&amp;T. ""How about this new Google phone?"" asks the wife. ""No way!"" says the husband. ""It lacks RAM, only brightens to 440 nits, and has a 2800mah battery! Also, Project Soli is not being used in the same ways as the concept video from years ago. It's a gimmick!"" This conversation has about a 0.05% chance of happening in any carrier store across the country.

I think it is more clear than ever how detached this sub is from reality. The common person that Google is targeting knows nothing and does not care about the technical aspects that are frequently upvoted to the top. The common person picks up a Google phone and says ""Huh, this phone was made by the company that provides the services I use on a daily basis"" and plays with the phone for a bit. They like the smoothness, the camera, and the look, and they buy. It really is that simple.

Google isn't targeting the enthusiasts. The OnePlus phones will always be the enthusiast phone. The Pixel 4 will guaranteed and without a doubt be the most popular Pixel to date, just by virtue of the fact that it now available in every phone carrier nationwide. 90%+ of the entire population buys their phones by walking in the store and playing with them.

People here are expecting the Pixel to sell iPhone levels while it was on 1 carrier and in way less countries. The entire point of Google's slow rollout on Verizon was to ensure they maintain the leverage to keep the carrier from adding their bloatware to the phones (see latest report that AT&amp;T Pixels are bloatware free). Google and Apple are the only two manufacturers that were able to pull this off.

I know its a meme on this sub to claim that all the 14-year olds could run Google better than they can, which is most evident in the constant bitching about shutting down services that nobody uses and nobody (besides Google) has data on how many people were even actively using.

Google's hardware business is about growth, period. As long as that is trending up, they are doing fine. They aren't making a phone to target this sub which represents the 1% of Android users. They are targeting the 99% of common users, who only want a good phone experience. If they can wave their hand in front of the phone to change tracks, its a cool party trick. They won't be jumping out the window saying REEEEEE why can't I rub my thumb to act as a dial like in the concept demo?!?!

Just feel like that needed to be said. I think Google's hardware sales (Pixel, Wifi, Home, Chromecast, etc) has only grown with each passing year and have no doubt this year will be the same. Thanks for reading.",0

"On the ""Spyware"" Case: Samsung Proofed to Be LYING, Personal Data were SENT This is in response to the Samsung's Qihoo 360 case. For those who don't know, there's a sensational post last week on Reddit, as a user claimed that Samsung partnered with a Chinese company Qihoo and pre-installed irremovable ""spyware"" on every Samsung phone and tablet. Long story short, I found the post to be jumping to conclusions, but Samsung's response later seemed a little fishy to me. Being a network security researcher, I went ahead and decompiled the APK myself. Though I'd like to believe Samsung, it is however proven that the Device Care app is **RECORDING IMEIs and SENDING BACK Uniquely Identifiable IDs back to Qihoo's server**. The findings I'm about to spill out can be repeated and is verifiable by anyone. Don't believe my words? Download the APK and decompile it following these steps. You will see the exact same code as me.

I uploaded the Device Care APK to the JADX Decompiler ([http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk)) and downloaded the files. Here are decompiled code in the following screenshots:  
[https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m](https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m)

Just see the screenshots yourselves. You don't need to be a tech wizard to see that **IMEI** is being fetched (3rd screenshot and 4th screenshot) and **Unique Identifiable ID** is being sent to Qihoo's servers (1st screenshot). In the last screenshot, you can even see that the CPU model, whether the user is using WIFI, the free storage space on your phone were also being sent to Qihoo's servers, but I guess that's already nothing compared to your IMEI and Uniquely Identifiable ID. Samsung is obviously deceiving the Android community, hoping we'll just take their word for it.

Among the decompiled files, there's an entire library (which served as a codebase for apps) that's called libmobilesafe360\_clear-jni-6.7.so. I also decompiled that library, using another decompiler ([https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)). The library contains the **exact same encryption keys** (the generation seed:  70&gt;@|:CF0z‚Ç¨.97:M0z|ovyrM) for encrypting HTTP traffic (yup, they would rather encrypt it using their own algorithm than using HTTPS) using the DES algorithm **as** the ones that was included in **360's contacts backup application.** This DES encryption key was proven by Chinese security researchers to be easily cracked and intercepted.

The final nail to the coffin for me to find out Samsung is lying is that the User-Agent string in the packets that were sent back to the server was straight up called ""**360clearsdk**"". How could this possibly be if Samsung was using their own code and was simply ""downloading Qihoo's definition database"" as they claimed?

Last but not least, though I guess this evidence is already not needed, this is the permission that the Device Care app has access to on my phone:  [https://imgur.com/e43NJQx](https://imgur.com/e43NJQx) . Notice the ""Phone"" permission. This is a clear telltale sign for apps to gather IMEI information.

I took a look back at Samsung's statements. At first, their respond on the Korean forum Naver was this one [https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese\_spyware\_preinstalled\_on\_all\_samsung/fdggokk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese_spyware_preinstalled_on_all_samsung/fdggokk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) , which basically says only the filtering database was being downloaded from Qihoo's server. After the original post has gained notoriety and people start demanding the removal of the app, Samsung told The Verge a completely different story: "" *The storage optimization process, including the scanning and removal of junk files, is fully managed by Samsung‚Äôs device care solution.* "" Note how their statement has changed. Samsung now didn't claim that the app was fully made by them, but rather using an ambiguous sentence ""...*is fully managed by Samsung's device care solution"",* which basically completely avoided answering the question directly.

Conclusion:  
Hard facts, which can be verified by anyone interested:  
1. The IMEI is being collected and Uniquely Identifiable ID was being sent to Qihoo's 360 server,  
2. The encryption key that Qihoo was using in its contacts backup app for Chinese domestic users is also used in the Device Care app. Since it uses HTTP, a malicious user can intercept the traffic, decrypt the packets following the guides written by Chinese security researchers, and retrieve your uniquely identifiable ID and IMEI,  
3. In summary of 1. and 2., this basically means that not only are Samsung and Qihoo 360 collecting your personal identifiable information (which possibly violates GDPR and many states' privacy laws in the US), they are also doing it in an extremely insecure way and hackers can eavesdrop these information.

Speculation:  
1. Since this issue has been brought up time after time before (though none has reached this time's popularity), Samsung quiets down the controversy by lying again and again. They probably bet the users are not technically proficient enough to decompile the code themselves.

Last but not least, yes, this is a new account, but a throwaway one. I am a network security researcher at a major international InfoSec company, and decompiling code may violate IP laws and perhaps a ton of ToS. I simply want the truth to be out there. I have also sent the above findings to various major media outlets. I just hope that Samsung could stop lying to the r/Android community, and tell us the entire truth. Thanks.",0

It came out REALLY well

Edit: I wanted to explain how the widgets worked, the music player widget can play next/previous songs by click either side, clicking the middle would play/pause the song. The weather widget will change based on weather and day/night. The new widget on the bottom will change the topic when you click on it.

Now I get maximum 9 apps on my freakin 6.5 inch smartphone screen. Does Google think I'm blind or something? Why do app icons need to be this big? The text area for the app name is even partially off-screen at the bottom. I realise that each device has a different DPI but c'mon, why aren't we at least allowed to change the size of these icons ourselves?

[https://i.imgur.com/ZZeFKn1.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ZZeFKn1.jpg)

As for the front page, I mean look at this... 2.65 apps displayed? One is even a video (bottom off-screen app). We already have ""Google Play Games"" where this garbage should be displayed. Is it crazy to say they should be separate and that not every Android user plays games?

Who is the idiot in charge of UI/UX at Google's Android department? Next update we're going to what, one app per entire device display window huh?

EDIT: I forgot to show this one too. Of both the above things, this is actually perhaps the worst change of all as it is actually malicious. Showing me completely unrelated apps at the top of the screen even when I searched for something totally different. The proximity of the ""Install"" button, next to the magnifying button for searching is deliberately so close as to make the user mistakenly tap ""Install"". If the app is small and your connection fast, it will be installed almost instantly. This is literally [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking).

"I lost my device recently. I found out that Samsung's Find My Phone is WAY better than Google's Find My Phone feature. Yesterday I ended up losing my Galaxy S9 inside my apartment's hallway, and apparently one of my neighbors took it (probably to keep it safe, rather than steal). Anyways, I panicked and I used both Samsung's and Google's Find My Phone features. Here is what I found to be way better on Samsung's version:

* You can actually prevent the other person from turning off your phone.
* You can track their location and keep the location history. It shows up nicely on the web map too.
* You can back up your phone remotely to Samsung Cloud (15 GB free).
* You can retrieve calls/messages.
* You can trigger the maximum power saving mode remotely.
* The Web UI is simpler and nicer imo.

The main issue with Google's version is, if the person just turns off your phone, you are done. You can't do anything anymore. With Samsung's version, you can enable maximum power saving mode AND prevent the person from turning off your phone. You now effectively have a long-lasting unstoppable tracker.",0

"PSA For anyone using IFTTT. IFTTT has moved to a monthly subscription model. They are restricting the basic free accounts to a maximum of 3 custom applets.

The pricing is $9.99 per month, but until october they are offering pay what you want pricing (from $1.99) which will work for the first year only.

As of right now they are not removing any applets you have created over the 3 applet limit on a free account, and these applets seem to be working still. But no telling how long that lasts.

This is really sad news for me, I had a few applets set up, and have used IFTTT for a long time. I had always been keen for a pro model which allowed for additional features, but never thought it would be this much, and didn't think they'd lock the existing features behind a paywall as well.

I think this is a bad thing if you are a developer (edit: it looks like it doesn't bother devs:)

"Prediction: Most phones in 2020 will have a hole-punch display. This is because Samsung kept the OLED hole-punch tech exclusive to themselves for a while, and that exclusivity has now most likely ended. Ice Universe, the well known Samsung leaker, stated a year ago that Samsung has the exclusive OLED laser hole punching technology for some time ([source](https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1065053321814138881?lang=en)). This is the reason why the Galaxy flagships were the only phones using OLED with hole-punch. We did see a few Chinese phones using the hole punch, but they all used an LCD display, which uses a different cutting method for the hole punch.

This year we saw OnePlus using pop-up cameras, others that have neither the pop-up or hole-punch tech keeping the notch and a few others like the Pixel embracing the forehead.

All this is predicted to change as Samsung's OLED hole punch exclusivity wears off. The Pixel 4A's render shows it will be using a hole punch display, and the same goes for the OnePlus 8 rumors and leaks. Pixel 5 and the next iPhone will likely follow suit.

EDIT: Looks like the [Huawei P40 Pro](https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1211094386601148416) will also have a hole-punch similar to the one on S10+.",0
"OnePlus justify the addition of Netflix and Facebook by saying they're adding it for enhancing HDR video playback and higher battery efficiency respectively OnePlus recently added a [subsection to their forum](https://forums.oneplus.com/forums/ideas/) named [""IDEAS""](https://www.oneplus.in/communityideas#/). They stated the goal was to take the best ideas by listening to their community and implementing it on their products. They actually went out of their way to explain their thought process behind some of the ideas they accepted and also provided an explanation for some ideas that were rejected. 

One of the [ideas](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/allow-user-to-choose-which-stock-apps-they-want-to-install-during-set-up.1174902/) was allowing users their choice of apps while setting up the phone. They rejected the idea saying they couldn't do that since users expect certain applications like the clock, calculator and gallery to work out of the box. However they also justified the addition of third party bloatware like Netflix and Facebook by saying they were added for enhancing HDR video playback and higher battery efficiency as they were popular with their users. 

I honestly don't know why a company would try to justify the addition of third party apps when it's obvious it's being done for other reasons as those apps are available on the Play Store should someone want to install them. It probably would have been better for them to not mention that bit at all. It's also sad to see them add third party apps since they've [stated](https://twitter.com/OnePlus_IN/status/742993952878567424) their phones have [no bloatware](https://twitter.com/OnePlus_UK/status/1098509256310050816) on [multiple occasions](https://twitter.com/OnePlus_USA/status/1238102795175309318).",0

"Happiness is only real, when shared. Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Instagram deliberately lowers quality on Android users. Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, deliberately lowers quality of uploads for Android users, compression happens on the server side, so there is no excuse, also they are using the same version of libx264, so again no excuse.

Does Apple pays Instagram to do this? Is this legal?

Why Does smartphone reviewers like /u/Marques-Brownlee , /u/ThisIsTechToday , UnboxTherapy never talk about this?

If is not illegal and it is not a disloyal, unfair action, why Google doesn't do the same for YouTube? Like deliberately lowers the quality of whatever it is uploaded from an iPhone or any other Apple product?

Here is a link of an article written in spanish that made some tests to prove what I‚Äôm saying.

[https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion](https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion)

Basically, doesn't matter what you use to shoot a video, even if you use a Red Camera, or a Canon DSLR, even if you shoot your videos on an iPhone! if you upload that video using an Android it will look like garbage, if you upload exactly the same video using iPhone it will look crystal clear.

Tik Tok for example doesn't do this, and the overall quality of the app looks a lot much better than Instagram because of the same reason, Android and Apple users can upload crystal clear videos if they have a good camera.

Why nobody is complaining? I love pixel phones, and I love the camera picture style, but there is no sense on having this quality if I can not share it with anyone.

If this was fixed a lot of people, influencers, and creatives will be able to switch to Android.

‚ÄúHappiness is only real, when shared""

EDIT: 
Please be aware that I'm not talking about recording video with the integrated camera app, I understand all the hardware variations that this involves and how hard it can be to achieve homogeneous results. I'm talking about uploading a video recorded with another app or device, using the app only as an uploader, shouldn't produce different results as the compression happens server side using the same version of x264 library.

EDIT2:
Someone suggested to use Instander, an instagram mod which can manipulate some flags inside the app, one of this flags is able to override the video upload quality bitrate, I try this with the suggested value of 10mb, and it really worked, the uploaded result looks a lot more sharper https://imgur.com/a/vya4QKs I will try a higher bitrate to see how hi can I go up, this also proves that it is just a setting and not a hardware variation in smartphones what is causing this as a lot of people suggest. I understand some phones might struggle with higher bitrates, but instagram could at least try higher values for latest processor chips, and not just put one low setting for everybody.

Another tool that yield interesting results was Inssist a chrome instagram client extension, you can upload stories and videos directly from your computer, however I found that this videos had to be carefully crafted, with a bitrate not very high so instagram don't compress them a lot, and not so low so they don't look ugly, in my tests using ffmpeg to encode the videos before uploading with a CRF of 20 or a 12mb VBR(6457k) yield very good results depending on the duration and darkness of the videos.",0

"Google needs to greatly expand Fast Pair functionality Google's Fast Pair technology has been available for some time now. But its availability on the market for true wireless headphones is almost nonexistent.  


To my knowledge, the only TWS to take advantage of this are Google Pixelbuds, Microsoft Surface Buds, and Realme Air Buds. 
I hope the next OnePlus Buds will be on the list.  


As you can see It is very insufficient. Google really needs to put more effort into getting the technology featured on all OEM TWS, like Galaxy Buds, Huawei Freebuds, Oppo Enco Free, Xiaomi Airdots, not to mention premiums TWS from Bose, Jabra, Sony and Seinnheiser.   
It would also be great if cheap TWS on Amazon could take advantage of it.   


At the moment only Android is compatible with Fast Pair. We have recently seen hints that they are working to bring it to Chrome OS, but it shouldn't take that long without showing disrespect to developers.

"With all this talk about how OnePlus has ""lost their way"" and ""lived long enough to see themselves become the villain"", I just remembered a hilarious story going back to their ""Flagship Killer"" Days You could not make this shit up. **TL;DR**: OnePlus co-founder claims in a forum post they undercut the competition by not having a profit margin, ""planned"" a cost breakdown infographic to prove it. Not only did they never deliver, co-founder's forum post mysteriously disappears.

A while ago, a Redditor made a post on /r/OnePlus about doing a university presentation on OnePlus, unable to find an annual report other than the one from 2014. They asked ""Do you think OnePlus has something to hide, financially?""

/u/carpe02 a.k.a. Carl Pei, co-founder of OnePlus, [chimed in, saying](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/76i23a/why_is_the_2014_annual_report_the_only_one/doe8bas/):

&gt;This is how we think: We're a product company. Judge us by our products.

&gt;It's easy to get caught up in the hype of profitless growth or valuation numbers, but ultimately those things mean nothing to consumers.

OP of the post replies:

&gt;This is a matter of transparency, in my opinion.

&gt;Is OnePlus not putting out annual reports because they are afraid the reports will be received badly?

&gt;Not giving out information about, for example, financial details stimulates speculation about what the facts are.

To which [I replied](https://www.reddit.com/r/oneplus/comments/76i23a/why_is_the_2014_annual_report_the_only_one/doecbvz/):

&gt;[It sure does.](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/manufacturing-costs.838/#post-33841) Especially for a company like OnePlus that was built upon profitless growth.

&gt;I‚Äôve always wondered what comprised the $50 difference between the 16 GB and 64 GB OPO.

I linked to a OnePlus Forums post ([#9 in the thread](http://archive.is/hqszU)) made by Carl saying:

&gt;We will not have a profit margin on the OnePlus One, and are planning a cost breakdown infographic to prove this. Stay tuned. :)

"Does anyone think Google Photos has gone downhill since the last major update? Honestly, I really think this new update (I realise it was a few weeks back) is appalling, and I'm interested to hear what others think now that there's been time to use it for a while.

My main issues are:

* For You has been intentionally removed to being a desktop site only feature. 
* The way historical photos are shown is now a forced slideshow instead of just letting you open a pic and look at it for as long as you want.
* If you want to create something, it's all hidden away under Library&gt; Utilities. 
* If you want to create a movie you now *only* have the option to do so in portrait mode, even if the original video is in landscape. 
* I don't like the new logo (not the biggest issue, to be fair) :-)

This was Google's very best app IMO and they have made a pig's ear of it. I honestly can't understand them sometimes.

"Here's a difference in image details between Google Pixel and Nokia 808 PureView for portrait pictures. After being disappointed by Samsung's hyped up S20 Ultra camera, which I had high hopes for, I decided to bust out my old Nokia 808 PureView to compare to my Google Pixel.

I know this an Android subreddit, but we discuss cameras quite often here and I just wanted to give the old king a shoutout (plus I'm comparing it to an Android phone).

This cameraphone just never fails to amaze me with its quality. I don't know what sorcery Nokia were doing in their labs but 808 is a special masterpiece.

Here's a comparison:

A back camera was used for both cameras.

Pair 1: [Google Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/T46740r.jpg), [808 PureView](https://i.imgur.com/875qsmU.jpg)

Pair 2: [Google Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/MKrlcmc.jpg), [808 PureView](https://i.imgur.com/jXpSXkS.jpg)

[Direct, 100% cropped comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Am2Y21b.jpg)

Look at them on a monitor at 100% resolution to really see the difference.

The level of difference in a natural look and just sheer details between a Google Pixel, which is one of the best camera phones on the market and Nokia 808 PureView is incredible!

In daylight, there is absolutely nothing that matches 808. It still has the largest sensor (not counting Panasonic CM1, which was more of a camera than a phone and 808 still produced better images). The sensor, lens and processing combination is still unmatched. No other cameraphone produces these soft, pleasing, yet highly detailed and realistic images 808 does.

If S20 Ultra came at least a bit close to this, I would have bought it.

It saddens me that this kinda of detail might never be matched or at least it will take a long, long time to match this. This phone is already 8 years old. People who worked on this cameraphone were geniuses and purists.",0
