,Android,"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**.

**Relevance to Android:**

Think of all the Android apps/software you use that use encryption. If this bill passes, all such software made by American companies or organizations (Signal, Whatsapp, etc.), would be illegal (at least for Americans) unless the software had a backdoor built into it for the US government to be able to access the encrypted data.

The law establishes a precedent for other nations to follow, and for further legislation to be passed, such as requiring encryption data to be unencrypted on demand (like in Australia), or outlawing encryption outright. The EFF has already spoken out about it (it's even worse than the EARN IT Act from three months ago). For these reasons, even non-Americans should be concerned.

It does nothing to stop criminals, either. They will continue downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices. All it will do is give a **huge** blow to average Americans who use American software. There will be obvious security problems having a built-in backdoor (criminals and hackers would exploit it), and the bill would set the precedent that encryption and privacy are bad/illegal/etc. Many businesses might leave the country, and people would lose their privacy.

**If you are an American:**

[Contact your two US senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Tell them to vote **NO** on the **Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act**

,Android,"There is an upcoming change to the YouTube ToS that states that:

&gt;YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO.

,Android,"Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it.

It is said that the result of the inquiry from Samsung Members Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer is that it does not use any function of 360 Security app, but outsourcing only DB checking for unnecessary files.

&amp;#x200B;

Deletion logic is handled by Samsung's logic, and it is said that 360 DB is used to check the Junk File that can delete files.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, Microsoft's Windows Defender also uses the Cloud method.

,Android,"When Apple introduced the new iPad Air with the fingerprint sensor embedded at the power button, [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-integrates-touch-id-fingerprint-unlock-into-top-button-on-new-ipad-air/) said the following:

""Android device makers, like Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones. 

Some of the popular features that we take for granted in Android has been introduced/popularized by Sony like IP-water resistance (as [early as 2013 in Xperia Z](https://techland.time.com/2013/07/10/sony-xperia-z-review/) , extra-tall displays, Stamina mode for battery longevity, 960fps recording etc.. Also, Sony has contributed so much to the Android AOSP and features such as[ Android theming](https://www.androidcentral.com/waiting-dawn-new-android-theming-era)  and [high res Bluetooth audio ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music) was borne out of Sony's contributions. 

Hopefully, more Android makers will adopt Sony's [charge and play](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-gaming-feature-charge-and-play-without-degrading-battery-health-h-s-power-control/amp/) battery mode, as it will help the battery.

Sony phones are so underrated.

,Android,"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green. 

Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.

This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.

Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. 

And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.

2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.

More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

,Android,"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted.

 Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 

1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  
Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   
To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 &lt;package\_name&gt;.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device / OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-10/how-to/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))


2. **Privacy:** 
   1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_IN) 
   2. More privacy options can be found in settings / app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.
   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempmail&amp;hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.
   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&amp;hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&amp;hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.
   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.
   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video / Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).


3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.
   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https://blokada.org/index.html) **/** [**DNS66**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.
   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md))
   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https://dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)


4. **Performance and battery:**
   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.
   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines / Tasker can be used to enhance battery life / performance, like
      1. Turn off Mobile Data / Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.
      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.
      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.
      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)
   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.
   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.
   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.
   6. Prefer Dark / Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.
   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.
   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.


5. **Other tips:**
   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https://vanced.app/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.
   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.
   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.
   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.
   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings-&gt;App-&gt;Default Apps.
   6. Using [**Your phone**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&amp;hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&amp;hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.
   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_IN) for more. 
   8. [**Hermit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&amp;hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.
   9. [**Firefox Send**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&amp;hl=en_IN) can be used to send files &lt; 2GB to anyone through a link.
   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&amp;hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.
   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.
   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.
   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.


PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.

I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.

,Android,"Update: This got more views than I expected, thank you for Gold and all the feedback, I found some new things about the phone's WiFi and Charging I'll update them with. 

I feel I should make clear of my hearing disability, it's not like regular hearing loss that can often be overcome with hearing aids. I have auditory neuropathy, symptoms are a headache to explain but to simplify, I hear sounds at near normal volume but I have difficulty understanding what words were spoken. With this disability, lip reading is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to communicate. Regular phone calls are impossible, video calls are doable with some difficulty.

With Google showing off Android 10 few months ago the Live Caption really caught my eye. Along with Live Caption they also showed Live Transcribe. Promising to deliver Live Caption to work for phone calls in the future. 

I had the original Pixel since launch, it was inside a drawer since I used iPhone 8 daily. I had the idea of updating the old Pixel to try out Live Transcribe, it worked, good enough to use but not perfect. I could even do a phone call by setting the Pixel next to iPhone 8 on Speaker.

Since that phone call I decided I will get the Pixel 4 XL. Note that Live Transcribe is not Pixel exclusive, I tested it on my friends Galaxy S10 and Note10 both functioned well as my original Pixel. Still, I figured Pixel phones will get the updates faster than Samsung and with Live Caption already on Pixel 4 I stuck with my decision. 

Now I pre-ordered and activated two Pixel 4 XL, White for me and Orange for my wife. We have had the phone for two days now and overall very satisfied with them with couple issues as well. 


Pros: 

- Live Transcribe works and you CAN use it to transcribe phone calls! This requires you to have the phone call on Speaker in the background with Live Transcribe app opened. I could communicate with the Live Transcribe transcribing everything I say and the person I was calling. 


- Recorder is also a great addition because it Transcribes! Only English supported for now but it records and also highlights the word spoken when you play the recording later. This is very helpful and I will use it often. I imagine students could use this to take notes in class. 


- Live Caption works well, haven't tested it too much yet because it doesn't work for call/video call. For YouTube, music and podcast it worked great. Some lyrics were wrong but that's expected. 


- The phone and build quality is very different from Pixels so far. All the previous Pixels I felt they could have done this and that to improve the design but this time I feel like they finally got it. I have a clear case because I love the Black/White matte thing going on. 


- Battery life feels normal but battery charging (plugged in) with included charger is holy lightning fast in comparison to my old iPhone 8. 5% to 100% is 1 HOUR.


Update: I'm a bit wrong about exactly 1 Hour but it's not too far off, plugged in charging is very good. I also resolved Wireless charging issue but I'll post that below under Cons.  


Cons: 

- The small accessibility button in bottom right corner is gone, we now need to swipe up with two fingers to access Live Transcribe as accessibility. There's options though, you can choose to get the old fashioned Back, Home, Apps, Accessibility stickman figure, it's a setting you can switch on easily. But that takes up a screen space. Or you could simply make an icon for Live Transcribe, it's what I did and put the icon on bottom right corner. The FRUSTRATING thing is that Google added Google Assistant to BOTH bottom corners! Like WHY CAN'T WE WE CHANGE WHAT THE CORNER SWIPE DOES!? Swipe up from bottom left.. Assistant, Swipe up from bottom right.. Assistant again. Grip the phone.. Assistant. Jeez we don't need so many options. Let us adjust the corner swipe up to Accessibility or anything, I imagine a calculator or flashlight would be more useful.

- WiFi is atrocious on Pixel 4 XL. I have AT&amp;T Fiber 1000 and well, both Pixel 4 XL were struggling to get full WiFi bars in room next to router, only got full bars when I was in the same room as the router. Now I'm hoping they could fix this with an update but I'm not counting on it. 

Update: WiFi is an issue with AT&amp;T. I have tried several different WiFi today and it seems main issue is at my house. 


- 90 Hz, does it exist? I don't notice it. Then again I've read posts saying it requires certain brightness level to activate. 

Update: Comments say we can force this in developer settings. But I've also seen posts where some had screen color change after this? Or something like that. 


- WIRELESS charging feels iffy. Day 1 I could charge it fully overnight on my old 7.5w Mophie Wireless charger, it didn't fast charge, just regular charge but it worked. Day 2 both my Pixel and my wife's failed to charge overnight on same Wireless charger. The difference was that I put on Speck Presidio Clear cases on both phones Day 2. The case isn't too thick, should work with Wireless charging. Maybe the 7.5w on top of having a case was the issue. Anyway I hope a stronger charger can fix this problem because Wireless charging is a huge plus in my life. Any recommendations for a charger would be appreciated, I'm also hoping Pixel Stand goes on sale during Black Friday. If that stand even works with this case.

UPDATE: Regarding Wireless charging I feel the issue is resolved but it was expensive. Today I went to various retailers to test out WiFi and Wireless chargers on display with the Inware app to check how fast each charger worked. The results were VERY DISAPPOINTING. Every single charger tested resulted in 8.4W • Fast except the Pixel Stand. While that sounds ok I really don't think it is. Among the tested were some 15w Wireless chargers, the new Samsung 15w charging stand included, resulted in 8.4W while this sounds like an ok speed for charging overnight... They all had some issues, either didn't charge at all, charged very very slowly or randomly stopped charging like the one I had before. Now this is where I spent money to fix this problem. Pixel Stand performed ridiculously well unlike all others. It fully charged my phone to 100% without issues and did it very quickly. On the Inware app where every other charger showed 8.4W, Pixel Stand showed 13.2W(!?!) And the speed was actually very fast. I'm not sure if it's a proper indicator of charge speed but 'Currents' showed similar number to plugged in charging speed, around 1800-2000. I will try to take and upload pictures next time I charge. I'm really hoping I wake up to 100% tomorrow morning. I read that Google made Pixel 4 Wireless compatible to fast charge as long as it's over 10W + EPP standard but this doesn't seem to be the case. It is struggling to charge on other chargers. 


Update: Another Con I discovered is that we can't take proper screenshots on Pixel! I found something about the keyboard, bottom left corner we have a button to hide keyboard. This should be abled to switch either bottom left or bottom right.. not everyone is left handed. This is where the screenshot issue happens, I can't take a screenshot of my keyboard! As far as I know the only way to take screenshots on Pixel 4 seems to be holding Power button, doing so will lower my keyboard, hiding it.

&lt;p&gt;I feel I should make clear of my hearing disability, it&amp;#39;s not like regular hearing loss that can often be overcome with hearing aids. I have auditory neuropathy, symptoms are a headache to explain but to simplify, I hear sounds at near normal volume but I have difficulty understanding what words were spoken. With this disability, lip reading is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to communicate. Regular phone calls are impossible, video calls are doable with some difficulty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Google showing off Android 10 few months ago the Live Caption really caught my eye. Along with Live Caption they also showed Live Transcribe. Promising to deliver Live Caption to work for phone calls in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had the original Pixel since launch, it was inside a drawer since I used iPhone 8 daily. I had the idea of updating the old Pixel to try out Live Transcribe, it worked, good enough to use but not perfect. I could even do a phone call by setting the Pixel next to iPhone 8 on Speaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since that phone call I decided I will get the Pixel 4 XL. Note that Live Transcribe is not Pixel exclusive, I tested it on my friends Galaxy S10 and Note10 both functioned well as my original Pixel. Still, I figured Pixel phones will get the updates faster than Samsung and with Live Caption already on Pixel 4 I stuck with my decision. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I pre-ordered and activated two Pixel 4 XL, White for me and Orange for my wife. We have had the phone for two days now and overall very satisfied with them with couple issues as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Transcribe works and you CAN use it to transcribe phone calls! This requires you to have the phone call on Speaker in the background with Live Transcribe app opened. I could communicate with the Live Transcribe transcribing everything I say and the person I was calling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recorder is also a great addition because it Transcribes! Only English supported for now but it records and also highlights the word spoken when you play the recording later. This is very helpful and I will use it often. I imagine students could use this to take notes in class. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Caption works well, haven&amp;#39;t tested it too much yet because it doesn&amp;#39;t work for call/video call. For YouTube, music and podcast it worked great. Some lyrics were wrong but that&amp;#39;s expected. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The phone and build quality is very different from Pixels so far. All the previous Pixels I felt they could have done this and that to improve the design but this time I feel like they finally got it. I have a clear case because I love the Black/White matte thing going on. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battery life feels normal but battery charging (plugged in) with included charger is holy lightning fast in comparison to my old iPhone 8. 5% to 100% is 1 HOUR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: I&amp;#39;m a bit wrong about exactly 1 Hour but it&amp;#39;s not too far off, plugged in charging is very good. I also resolved Wireless charging issue but I&amp;#39;ll post that below under Cons.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cons: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The small accessibility button in bottom right corner is gone, we now need to swipe up with two fingers to access Live Transcribe as accessibility. There&amp;#39;s options though, you can choose to get the old fashioned Back, Home, Apps, Accessibility stickman figure, it&amp;#39;s a setting you can switch on easily. But that takes up a screen space. Or you could simply make an icon for Live Transcribe, it&amp;#39;s what I did and put the icon on bottom right corner. The FRUSTRATING thing is that Google added Google Assistant to BOTH bottom corners! Like WHY CAN&amp;#39;T WE WE CHANGE WHAT THE CORNER SWIPE DOES!? Swipe up from bottom left.. Assistant, Swipe up from bottom right.. Assistant again. Grip the phone.. Assistant. Jeez we don&amp;#39;t need so many options. Let us adjust the corner swipe up to Accessibility or anything, I imagine a calculator or flashlight would be more useful. 
Pixel 4 XL Corner swipes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/bYoBB5h""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/bYoBB5h&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;WiFi is atrocious on Pixel 4 XL. I have AT&amp;amp;T Fiber 1000 and well, both Pixel 4 XL were struggling to get full WiFi bars in room next to router, only got full bars when I was in the same room as the router. Now I&amp;#39;m hoping they could fix this with an update but I&amp;#39;m not counting on it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: WiFi is an issue with AT&amp;amp;T. I have tried several different WiFi today and it seems main issue is at my house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;90 Hz, does it exist? I don&amp;#39;t notice it. Then again I&amp;#39;ve read posts saying it requires certain brightness level to activate. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Comments say we can force this in developer settings. But I&amp;#39;ve also seen posts where some had screen color change after this? Or something like that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WIRELESS charging feels iffy. Day 1 I could charge it fully overnight on my old 7.5w Mophie Wireless charger, it didn&amp;#39;t fast charge, just regular charge but it worked. Day 2 both my Pixel and my wife&amp;#39;s failed to charge overnight on same Wireless charger. The difference was that I put on Speck Presidio Clear cases on both phones Day 2. The case isn&amp;#39;t too thick, should work with Wireless charging. Maybe the 7.5w on top of having a case was the issue. Anyway I hope a stronger charger can fix this problem because Wireless charging is a huge plus in my life. Any recommendations for a charger would be appreciated, I&amp;#39;m also hoping Pixel Stand goes on sale during Black Friday. If that stand even works with this case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;UPDATE: Regarding Wireless charging I feel the issue is resolved but it was expensive. Today I went to various retailers to test out WiFi and Wireless chargers on display with the Inware app to check how fast each charger worked. The results were VERY DISAPPOINTING. Every single charger tested resulted in 8.4W • Fast except the Pixel Stand. While that sounds ok I really don&amp;#39;t think it is. Among the tested were some 15w Wireless chargers, the new Samsung 15w charging stand included, resulted in 8.4W while this sounds like an ok speed for charging overnight... They all had some issues, either didn&amp;#39;t charge at all, charged very very slowly or randomly stopped charging like the one I had before. Now this is where I spent money to fix this problem. Pixel Stand performed ridiculously well unlike all others. It fully charged my phone to 100% without issues and did it very quickly. On the Inware app where every other charger showed 8.4W, Pixel Stand showed 13.2W(!?!) And the speed was actually very fast. I&amp;#39;m not sure if it&amp;#39;s a proper indicator of charge speed but &amp;#39;Currents&amp;#39; showed similar number to plugged in charging speed, around 1800-2000. I will try to take and upload pictures next time I charge. I&amp;#39;m really hoping I wake up to 100% tomorrow morning. I read that Google made Pixel 4 Wireless compatible to fast charge as long as it&amp;#39;s over 10W + EPP standard but this doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be the case. It is struggling to charge on other chargers. &lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"Howdy folks, You have likely seen the iOS shortcut ""I'm being pulled over"". Well Google Assistant makes it pretty easy to build something similar but not as advanced.

I wanted to provide a tutorial on how I managed something similar.

    Open Google Home
    Add Routine
    When - I'm getting pulled over
        It will auto update to 'I say ""I'm getting pulled over""'
    Add Action
        Browse Popular Actions
            Send a Text - Enter Number and ""I am having an interaction with the police please check my Google Photos for a video as my phone has started recording this incident.""
            Put Phone on Silent
            Adjust Media Volume (0)
        Enter a Command
            Turn off auto brightness
            Set my screen brightness to 0
            Turn on do not disturb        
            Take a selfie video

I chose selfie video so that I have a recording of myself so that I do not potentially violate any laws. Feel free to modify it anyway you want.

If anyone has any recommendations on how to tweak this please let me know and I will update.

\* I have shared my Google Photos with my fiance so she has access to any time. Also I am on unlimited data with Google Fi so my Google Photos is set to backup on mobile data (so no need to change that setting).

*There are some limitations for for Google Assistant and what it can automate on your phone. If you want a more complete solution look at IFTTT, Tasker, AutomateIT, and others.*

**Edit:** I am making edits as recommendations for modifications come in.

**Edit 2:** Please take a look at ACLU Mobile Justice and download the App. You can easily edit the above Routine to ask your phone to open that app:  [https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct](https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct) and at the ACLU Know Your Rights page:  [https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/)

**Edit 3:**  from [Aperture\_Kubi](https://www.reddit.com/user/Aperture_Kubi) \-  Slight problem if you're trying to do this in your home and you have Google Home hardware that picks up the command instead. I tried it with the trigger being ""panic mode"" for more general use. *Summary - Any Nest or Google Home devices in your home will activate based on these hotwords as well but be unable to activate them on your phone.*

**Edit 4 REQUEST:** Has anyone been able to get Google Assistant to auto stream to any platform? If yes, please tag me in your comment and I will update the post with your instructions.

**Edit 5**: A few folks have commented on the laws of recording interactions with police. Summary: Notify the police that the interaction is being recorded. Please check with your state laws on recording during traffic stops. The ACLU link above has some great details on your rights.

**Edit 6**:  from [andyooo](https://www.reddit.com/user/andyooo) \-  There are apps like Nova Launcher mentioned below (and Tasker) that have a ""system lock"" action, which disables biometrics (see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/) for more). This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock) and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add ""open Lock"" to your Assistant routine. If you don't trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory's developer, you can use them to make a ""system lock"" task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it's unambiguous to Assistant what it should ""open""). Going that way I'd recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.

**Edit 7**: from [xcheet](https://www.reddit.com/user/xcheet) \-  Google Home is not needed. Routines can be created inside Assistant using the instructions on this page: [Check Google Support](https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7672035?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;hl=en) ",t2_2rk0cgn8,False,,0,False,"""Hey Google, I'm Being Pulled Over""",[],r/Android,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_haraqv,False,dark,0.93,,public,4182,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,4182,,False,self,1592850931.0,,[],{'gid_1': 1},self,,True,,1592429942.0,text,6,,,text,self.Android,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Howdy folks, You have likely seen the iOS shortcut &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m being pulled over&amp;quot;.

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I chose selfie video so that I have a recording of myself so that I do not potentially violate any laws. Feel free to modify it anyway you want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anyone has any recommendations on how to tweak this please let me know and I will update.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* I have shared my Google Photos with my fiance so she has access to any time. Also I am on unlimited data with Google Fi so my Google Photos is set to backup on mobile data (so no need to change that setting).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are some limitations for for Google Assistant and what it can automate on your phone. If you want a more complete solution look at IFTTT, Tasker, AutomateIT, and others.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I am making edits as recommendations for modifications come in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 2:&lt;/strong&gt; Please take a look at ACLU Mobile Justice and download the App. You can easily edit the above Routine to ask your phone to open that app:  &lt;a href=""https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct""&gt;https://www.aclu.org/issues/criminal-law-reform/reforming-police/aclu-apps-record-police-conduct&lt;/a&gt; and at the ACLU Know Your Rights page:  &lt;a href=""https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/""&gt;https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 3:&lt;/strong&gt;  from &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/Aperture_Kubi""&gt;Aperture_Kubi&lt;/a&gt; -  Slight problem if you&amp;#39;re trying to do this in your home and you have Google Home hardware that picks up the command instead. I tried it with the trigger being &amp;quot;panic mode&amp;quot; for more general use. &lt;em&gt;Summary - Any Nest or Google Home devices in your home will activate based on these hotwords as well but be unable to activate them on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 4 REQUEST:&lt;/strong&gt; Has anyone been able to get Google Assistant to auto stream to any platform? If yes, please tag me in your comment and I will update the post with your instructions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 5&lt;/strong&gt;: A few folks have commented on the laws of recording interactions with police. Summary: Notify the police that the interaction is being recorded. Please check with your state laws on recording during traffic stops. The ACLU link above has some great details on your rights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 6&lt;/strong&gt;:  from &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/andyooo""&gt;andyooo&lt;/a&gt; -  There are apps like Nova Launcher mentioned below (and Tasker) that have a &amp;quot;system lock&amp;quot; action, which disables biometrics (see &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/7imzv1/tip_quickly_disable_fingerprint_unlock_and/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more). This necessarily requires device admin permission so you have to reasonably trust the app. Someone in the comments mentioned &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lsc.lock""&gt;this app&lt;/a&gt; and said they were using exactly in the way you intend it too, just add &amp;quot;open Lock&amp;quot; to your Assistant routine. If you don&amp;#39;t trust the app but trust Tasker and Tasker Factory&amp;#39;s developer, you can use them to make a &amp;quot;system lock&amp;quot; task, then export it as app and give it any name you want (e.g. so it&amp;#39;s unambiguous to Assistant what it should &amp;quot;open&amp;quot;). Going that way I&amp;#39;d recommend targeting an older API because targeting a recent one for some reason requires the app running as a foreground service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit 7&lt;/strong&gt;: from &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/user/xcheet""&gt;xcheet&lt;/a&gt; -  Google Home is not needed. Routines can be created inside Assistant using the instructions on this page: &lt;a href=""https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/7672035?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;hl=en""&gt;Check Google Support&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"After 10 years on Android, I'm tired of Google. I'm *not* tired of Android itself; this isn't a post about me trying to validate switching to another OS (\*cough* iOS). I'm tired of the mess that Google has allowed Android to become.

To begin, here's a list of smartphones that I've owned (or at least remember owning; a decade is a long time):

    - HTC Evo 4G

    - iPhone 4S (for like 2 weeks before running back to the S2)

    - Motorola Moto X (original)
    - Samsung Galaxy Note 2

About me: I'm in my late 20s and I'm in the US. I use most of Google's core products/offerings - Gmail, Photos, Drive, GPM/YTM/YT Premium, etc.  

---------------------------------

The beauty of Android is that you have choice and, for the most part, control over what you do and what you use. For example, I'm not really sold on Pixels because I find them to be too limited for my liking (e.g. no expandable storage, no headphone jack, etc). But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it *does* fit their needs. And that's awesome. On iOS, all you've got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don't like its features.

I've used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I'm just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. 

- One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven't looked back. And I'm glad that I haven't, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I've tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that's what I should expect from ""YouTube Music"".

- Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don't have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn't give me any notifications half the time.

---------------------------------

But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google's Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I've seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I've also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. 

Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:

- **In the literal decade I've been using Android, we still don't have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.** iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps

- **We're past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support**. Even flagship ""killers"", like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I'm not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you've got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you're screwed out of aftermarket support

- For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android's features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won't do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn't control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they're also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to [force OEMs to add ""powered by Android"" on their bootscreens](https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/). One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy

- **The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features**. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they're often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don't understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn't leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it's become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they've had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it's better that it comes from Google because then it's available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn't apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features

- **Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes**. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it's Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because ""Android 10.1"" is being released as ""Android 11"". Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)

- **RCS still doesn't have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.** You're still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don't). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don't want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they're hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for *everyone*, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone

- **Google is still a ""faceless"" company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.** Google will also randomly ban people's entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as ""being used in a way that violates Google's policies"" (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with *someone else* who has ""done so."" [Example](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/) (and this one *was* resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you're really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time

- If you *do* own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it's not just the Pixel. A lot of Google's apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you're located

- We don't have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn't an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)

- Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they're often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they're allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn't want people using other carriers

So I'm here, stuck in the middle. I don't know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very ""self-service""/""you're on your own"". I don't root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is /r/Android, and Android is supposed to be a ""platter"" for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple's long-term support and adding of features (because they're the only real alternative mobile OS).

Does anyone else feel similar?

But there are people who find the Pixel to be great, because it &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; fit their needs. And that&amp;#39;s awesome. On iOS, all you&amp;#39;ve got is the iPhone, and tough luck if you don&amp;#39;t like its features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve used Android instead of iOS (for the past 10 years) because it allows me to do more and fits my daily routines better. Having real file management, and letting apps work in the background (Photos backups, Spotify downloads, etc) is great. But in terms of Google products and their image as a company, I&amp;#39;m just so jaded and burnt out by them. I find myself looking for alternatives to their products now more than ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first times I jumped ship from a Google service was from Google Play Music to Spotify. While I had personal music uploaded, I mostly used GPM like one would Spotify or Apple Music -- for new music and curated playlists. The service was mostly great despite not having any official desktop app, but Google really let the Android app get old and buggy. Swiping through songs on the Now Playing screen, or even scrolling through playlists caused rubberbanding, unrelated to device performance. Songs would randomly not play. Etc. Most of my friends were on Spotify anyway, so switching made it easier for us to trade songs and playlists. I switched and haven&amp;#39;t looked back. And I&amp;#39;m glad that I haven&amp;#39;t, because YouTube Music is a mess. I still have a GPM/YTM subscription because of the introductory pricing, and I&amp;#39;ve tried the service. It lacks common sense features like sorting on the web interface, and overall just feels like a YouTube audio player skin because of the way it looks and behaves. But I guess that&amp;#39;s what I should expect from &amp;quot;YouTube Music&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example was switching to the Outlook Android app for my Gmail accounts. What made me do it initially was Google killing Inbox (RIP) and taking their sweet time rolling out dark mode for Gmail (despite their other apps both randomly supporting and not supporting dark mode). But I found that Outlook was a lot more focused and cleaner, on top of offering a true dark (AMOLED) mode. I also don&amp;#39;t have any ads in my inbox anymore. Everything just works, and I always get notified of important emails, unlike with the Gmail app that didn&amp;#39;t give me any notifications half the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But those are just random examples of Google apps; why am I here complaining about Google&amp;#39;s Android altogether? Well, in my 10 years of using Android, I&amp;#39;ve seen it improve, both aesthetically and functionally. But I&amp;#39;ve also seen Google shift focus from bettering the ecosystem for everyone to making change for the sake of change, and not addressing major painpoints for both users and developers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just some examples of things I think need addressing in Android altogether:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the literal decade I&amp;#39;ve been using Android, we still don&amp;#39;t have a proper, native, fully-inclusive backup and restore system.&lt;/strong&gt; iOS has had this since Day 1. The best you can do is root and use Titanium Backup (which is fairly hit and miss, especially when restoring on a different device). Or you can use an OEM application which never includes app data for 3rd party apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We&amp;#39;re past the $1,000 USD mark for flagship devices with barely adequate software support&lt;/strong&gt;. Even flagship &amp;quot;killers&amp;quot;, like OnePlus are charging about as much. And for what, 2 years of support on average? If you buy a cheaper device, like a Moto G, not only do you lose common features (like NFC), but you either get 1 or no major updates. Again, I&amp;#39;m not advocating that people go out and buy an iPhone. But, completely separate from that, what is the point of investing in short-lived devices anymore? They continue to function perfectly fine, but they are no longer updated, which is important when Google fixes bugs or adds new APIs for common features in their version updates. And if you&amp;#39;ve got a locked bootloader (which is most major flagships sold in the US, at least), you&amp;#39;re screwed out of aftermarket support&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the most part, you can either buy a Pixel for an extra (3 total) Android version updates. Or you can buy a more fully-featured device (e.g. Samsung Galaxy whatever) and put up with only 2 major Android updates, but you have most of the next version of Android&amp;#39;s features already. You can argue that, since Google is developing the entire OS, they should be providing more than 3 years of support (and OEMs more than 2, for sure). Especially when Apple provides 5. Either way, perfectly capable devices are having their support dropped, and Google won&amp;#39;t do anything about it. I understand that Google doesn&amp;#39;t control Qualcomm or the other OEMs, but they&amp;#39;re also a multi-billion dollar corporation that develops and controls and entire ecosystem. Do something impactful about it. I mean, fuck, they were able to &lt;a href=""https://9to5google.com/2019/10/07/powered-by-android-branding-2020/""&gt;force OEMs to add &amp;quot;powered by Android&amp;quot; on their bootscreens&lt;/a&gt;. One cannot claim that Android is about choice, while also saying that the Pixel is the only acceptable device for people to buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The OEMs are leading in terms of common-sense features&lt;/strong&gt;. Samsung and other OEMs have had things like scrolling screenshots, screen recording (WITH internal + microphone audio), customizable task changer, etc. Google, meanwhile, introduces these features several years later, and they&amp;#39;re often broken, half-baked, or inferior to the ones they are derived from. I don&amp;#39;t understand why a company with the size and resources of Google isn&amp;#39;t leading the pack and integrating these features into the core OS from the get-go. Yeah, it&amp;#39;s become kind of a meme at this point, where non-Pixel users say that they&amp;#39;ve had such and such feature for a while, and Pixel users argue that it&amp;#39;s better that it comes from Google because then it&amp;#39;s available to everyone. That last part is true, but it doesn&amp;#39;t apply when a lot of devices are being left behind in terms of Android updates and Google takes forever to add those features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Collections of minor Android changes/fixes are being labeled and released as entire version changes&lt;/strong&gt;. Once upon a time, Google used to release Android 4.4, 4.4.1, 4.4.2, etc with fixes and minor new features. Now, it&amp;#39;s Android 8.0, 9.0, 10, 11, etc. This, combined with most flagship devices only promising two major Android updates, means that most devices will never see updated system-wide APIs (RCS?) and features because &amp;quot;Android 10.1&amp;quot; is being released as &amp;quot;Android 11&amp;quot;. Even Apple does it the old school way to this day; for the most part only their major OS updates are labeled with a full number (e.g. iOS 14)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RCS still doesn&amp;#39;t have an API, ~5 years after RCS was announced.&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;#39;re still stuck using either Google Messages (which is just another app for most people to download) or praying that your carrier/OEM messaging app has RCS built in (99% don&amp;#39;t). Yes, I also use Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. But RCS is supposed to be universal and just work without needing to download any additional apps (which people in some parts of the world don&amp;#39;t want to do in order to talk to one person). Apple is/was supposed to implement RCS, but with even Google barely doing a good job, I can see why they&amp;#39;re hesitant/dragging their feet. This seems trivial to the rest of the world, but in the US most people you encounter have an iPhone, which will default to SMS when messaging an Android user. So most people end up inadvertently using SMS. SMS sucks for &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt;, and RCS is supposed to be the new lowest-common-communication method for everyone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google is still a &amp;quot;faceless&amp;quot; company in terms of support, and developers often have no idea why their apps are taken off the Play Store.&lt;/strong&gt; Google will also randomly ban people&amp;#39;s entire Google accounts for vague reasons, such as &amp;quot;being used in a way that violates Google&amp;#39;s policies&amp;quot; (without explaining what happened), or simply Google associating you with &lt;em&gt;someone else&lt;/em&gt; who has &amp;quot;done so.&amp;quot; &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/7nrx07/google_permanently_banned_my_account_because/""&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt; (and this one &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; resolved). So developers end up not taking Android as seriously as iOS because, while the barrier to entry is lower (e.g. no $99/year Developer Account), you&amp;#39;re really not getting much, if any support, and your account can get shut down at any time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; own or are able to buy a Pixel, features are restricted by country. Actually, scratch that; it&amp;#39;s not just the Pixel. A lot of Google&amp;#39;s apps/features/products/services are simply not available outside the US. That leads to people buying other devices, which usually end up being cheaper anyway while performing the same or better. Meanwhile, if you buy an iPhone anywhere in the world, not only can you get physical, in-person support almost anywhere in the world, but the phone performs just about the same regardless of where you&amp;#39;re located&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;We don&amp;#39;t have a standardized IMS (VoLTE/Wifi Calling) framework, which means that you have to cross your fingers that devices brought from one carrier to another fully function on their network. This isn&amp;#39;t an issue with iOS, even if you argue that Apple is only supporting a single OS on a handful of phones. This is really important, because you need it to work in order to call and text over LTE (and soon 5G) as 2G and 3G networks are recycled into LTE and 5G (which is currently happening)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carriers are still allowed to modify/add/remove system components on devices, and still control/gatekeep the updates on many of them. This is especially bad in the US vs the rest of the world, because carriers have even more control here. So now you have multiple SKUs of the same device, meaning they&amp;#39;re often treated as entirely different devices. Again, not an issue on iOS as a SIM lock is really all that they&amp;#39;re allowed to do. Even Google allows this with their own phones, as Verizon and DoComo have an entirely different set of Pixel SKUs with locked bootloaders and purposely-disabled LTE bands. Verizon even disabled eSIM for the longest time because they didn&amp;#39;t want people using other carriers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#39;m here, stuck in the middle. I don&amp;#39;t know what the solution is for all of this is other than Google restructuring their Android division or something. None of their app developers seem to speak with each other, and Android feels very &amp;quot;self-service&amp;quot;/&amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re on your own&amp;quot;. I don&amp;#39;t root my phones anymore, especially because Google punishes people who do (SafetyNet / hardware attestation incoming), nor do I want to rely on XDA/homebrew apps to do the things the core OS should do. I really think that Google needs to get their shit together. Not just with Android, but this is &lt;a href=""/r/Android""&gt;/r/Android&lt;/a&gt;, and Android is supposed to be a &amp;quot;platter&amp;quot; for their services. The more I visit reddit and read blogs like Android Police, the more I see comments from people simply burnt out and giving up. Even the site authors are putting out articles praising Apple&amp;#39;s long-term support and adding of features (because they&amp;#39;re the only real alternative mobile OS).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone else feel similar?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I also want to add the random A/B testing (when some users get new features like dark mode, and others don&amp;#39;t) and beta-like updates; frequently Google puts out updates that break something, particularly on Pixel devices, but also for their apps themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"SO thats a question im asking myself the last few days while reading about the new IPhone SE everywhere.

All reviews im reading or watching ( LTT , Dave Lee , etc.) are talking about the great value of this new device. But i can not wrap my head around it. 

Im one a Samsung Galaxy A51 and fail to see how this new IPhone is even close to being a ""value for your money"" phone. BUT before everyone is going ahead writing how this phone has the best mobile processor on the market - hear me out first ..

All im doing is writing Whatsapp Messages ( yea im in Europe, Germany - there is absolutely no point in iMessage over here ), browsing reddit, watching Youtube Videos ( which is amazing on such a nice big AMOLED Screen ) and taking photos ( which is super nice with the variety of cameras on the back and totally enough for my personal use - i dont need super professional photos for pesonal use on my phone and its got 128 GB of storage for everything )  While all these tasks can be done for a very long time due to 4.000 mAh battery 

Now the big thing is that all these things run smoothly - absolutely no problems whatsoever. Do most people really do more with their phones? Im talking about more demanding tasks.

From my point of view everybody fails to talk about real Budget phones ( Do they even exist in their world ) Its always about ""Big new flagship here - big new flagship there - flagship killer over there - OH THERE IS AN IPHONE FOR 479€ THATS HUGE BANG FOR BUCK ) ... while im on my device thats 289€ of the shelf and looking better for everything i do.

Where am i going wrong? Do i fail to see why the processor is such a big deal on a phone thats doing nothing for professional use? Do Tech reviewers dont know about things like the Galaxy A-Series? Or any budget Series for that matter ( I dont care at all about brands ) 

Im absolutely not bashing on Apple or Android or anything else - i really want to understand what im not seeing. Maybe someone can help me out here.

Or maybe im not the guy to know about brand-value .. maybe im just living in my own parallel Universe lol

Edit: Guys. I didn't mean to be rude - my intention was simply to understand the other point of view. There is no need for another 80 comments to point out that software support is important and how my phone will not run for 5 years but the iPhone does ( even though my SO got a Galaxy A5 (2017) which runs perfectly fine ). I do understand that (very) important argument. But nonetheless - I do still think they could have made the SE more 2020 than 2016 - still give it a good price tag and still give it software support. 
That said, please be nice to each other, I just wanted to be educated ! :) Peace to the apple folks out there

Edit #2: I've read A LOT of your comments and came to a conclusion. As someone in the comments pointed out - yes I'm living in a parallel universe.

Yes.. decent phones now a days come with storage as little as 64Gb up to 1TB on the Galaxy S10+ but you&amp;#39;d still want to be able to store high quality videos and photos on your expandable storage when the internal storage runs out--  let alone music and movies without having to stream it. Those long flights and rides w/o the internet..underground trains anyone? I know we can store our media in the cloud-- but seriously, can we have that choice to have our own files with US instead of it floating in cyberspace waiting for someone to hack it?    My current phone has 128GB internal storage, after the OS and update hog, I barely have 90 GB left, thus having an SD card is the way to go.  How many of you still use it? Or NOT use it?&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"I don't scroll through here that often, so I don't know the general consensus on Apple products here, so forgive me if I'm not saying anything new or if I'm deviating too much from the public opinion here I guess.

So as funny as it is to see iOS introduce old Android features as ""new"" year after year, it does make switching more of an option to me honestly. As a MacBook Pro user, I started out completely ignoring the idea of getting an iPhone to pair with my laptop better, I felt iPhones were just too limiting. But the two OS's have really started to become much more similar than before in terms of general, everyday feature set.

I don't feel like I'd miss much switching from my S10e to an iPhone now. I'd only miss freely downloading apks, YouTube Vanced (audio with the screen off for free), and GCam. But besides that, with great cameras, fast speed, grouped notifications, an app drawer, widgets, fluid animations, and so on, iOS now feels like Android with way less sacrifice than ever before. Hell, if I wanted I could get an iPhone X for less than the price of a new flagship Android and get more software updates and support than the usual Android phones and basically the same performance. 

And I'm sure now, with Android refining design, speed, and features, more iOS users are thinking Android feels like iOS with more options.

,Android,"I noticed my wife changed her lockscreen font on her Pixel 3a XL.

Somehow I had never seen the ability to do that, but it looked interesting.

I created a custom theme from setting &gt; display &gt; style and theme

To be funny, I named it:

😎😎😎

The joke was on me, as I can now not even get into the display menu without it crashing.

I contacted Google, and their best suggestion is to completely reset my phone.

Which would be great if Google backup actually worked well.

So now I'm trying to decide if I want to just never go into that menu again, or bite the bullet and completely reconfigure my phone.

Thanks, google!

,Android,"I used Android exclusively since the T-Mobile G1. Since then, I always got the latest Android phones. That includes notable phones like the Samsung Galaxy S2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. The Note 7. The Motorola Atrix. The Moto X. The Nexus 1, 4, 5, 6. Then finally the Pixel series starting with the 1, 2, 3, and now the 4.

Last month I had an itching to try something new in quarantine, so I switched from my Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 Pro. There was initially a lot to like (build quality and screen mainly), but there were so many annoying quirks that I could not stand it for more than a month.

If I could sum up my experience with the iPhone in one sentence, it would be ""Fantastic hardware, horrendous software"". iOS needs a ton of work in my opinion. Below is a recap of my issues with iOS:

&amp;#x200B;

* Notifications are a mess
   * Why are there two notification screens? ""Lockscreen"" and ""Notification center"". So many times I would think I've dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.
   * It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.
   * You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.
   * If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn't dismiss it from your notifications. I've already read it, why is it still in my notifications?
   * The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping ""by app"" in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc
* Gestures
   * You can only go ""back"" by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.
   * There is no dedicated ""back"" button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to ""swipe away"" this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.
* Home screen layout
   * Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it's such a pain in the ass. Why can't I hide apps or have an app drawer?
   * You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.
* Apps
   * Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is ""voluntary bloatware"". I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc
   * Can't set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit ""navigate"", and it opened Apple Maps. There's no way to change this behavior.
   * Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.
   * There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.
* Keyboards
   * I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.
   * If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no ""slide typing"" functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?
   * If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having ""2 apps for every app"" like I mentioned in the Apps section above.
* Camera/Photos
   * The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow
   * Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I've only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it's seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn't understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a ""live view"" of what the portrait shot will look like.
   * Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there's no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let's start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.
* Background processes
   * It's 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don't understand why.
* iMessage/FaceTime
   * FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I'm a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn't really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime's moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to ""reply to"" a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.

&amp;#x200B;

The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.

I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won't or can't fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.",t2_9m83g,False,,0,False,"After 10 years of Android, I switched to an iPhone 11 Pro. I switched back after a month.

&lt;p&gt;Last month I had an itching to try something new in quarantine, so I switched from my Pixel 4 to an iPhone 11 Pro. There was initially a lot to like (build quality and screen mainly), but there were so many annoying quirks that I could not stand it for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could sum up my experience with the iPhone in one sentence, it would be &amp;quot;Fantastic hardware, horrendous software&amp;quot;. iOS needs a ton of work in my opinion. Below is a recap of my issues with iOS:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Notifications are a mess

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why are there two notification screens? &amp;quot;Lockscreen&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Notification center&amp;quot;. So many times I would think I&amp;#39;ve dismissed a notification only to find 100+ notifications in the notification center.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It takes two swipes to get rid of a notification. This makes no sense.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only dismiss a notification by swiping left. Swiping right does nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are actively using the phone and a notification banner pops up, and you dismiss it, that doesn&amp;#39;t dismiss it from your notifications. I&amp;#39;ve already read it, why is it still in my notifications?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grouping of notifications are an absolute disaster. I use WhatsApp a lot. It shows you each individual message. Extremely cluttered. If I get 100 messages in a group over the span of an hour, it shows me all 100. I was able to somewhat fix this by grouping &amp;quot;by app&amp;quot; in the settings. But this just groups it all together, so that when I click on it to expand, I am staring at 100 notifications again. Android groups these by app, with subgroups for the WhatsApp groups, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gestures

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can only go &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; by swiping from the left. Swiping from the right is to go forward. Going forward is extremely rare. Both sides should be to go back, imo. I had to constantly reach my thumb awkwardly across the screen to swipe from the left.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no dedicated &amp;quot;back&amp;quot; button. There is no consistency in how it is implemented. Using an app was always a guess on how it works. Does this app have a back function? Or do I need to swipe down in order to &amp;quot;swipe away&amp;quot; this screen? Or do I need to click the back arrow in the top left corner? Sometimes I would have to try going back 3 times, nothing worked, then just dismiss to my home screen or shut down the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Home screen layout

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of an app drawer. All of my apps were always cluttered on my home screen. I try to make it look pretty by balancing it on different screens, but it&amp;#39;s such a pain in the ass. Why can&amp;#39;t I hide apps or have an app drawer?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You cannot put your apps on the bottom row. They always start at the top left corner and work their way down the home screen. So you have to constantly reach to the top of the screen to open your apps. Just poor software design with no thought of the user, imo.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apps

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Voluntary bloatware. Google apps oftentimes just work better than their Apple counterparts. GMail, Google Maps, Google Photos, Google Drive, GBoard, and more. What this results in is &amp;quot;voluntary bloatware&amp;quot;. I now have two maps apps, two photos apps, two cloud drive apps, etc&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can&amp;#39;t set default apps. I could avoid Apple Maps for the most part. But in one experience a friend texted me their address. I highlighted it, hit &amp;quot;navigate&amp;quot;, and it opened Apple Maps. There&amp;#39;s no way to change this behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Apple Maps should not be in public release. In my (admittedly limited) experience with it, it is years behind Google Maps. Even the animations within the app were janky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is no way to open links in an app automatically. On Android, if I click a reddit link in Chrome, it opens the post in my reddit app. On the iPhone, that is simply not possible. Same for any link in a browser for any app. It was more annoying than it sounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keyboards

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I use GBoard. It was always Russian roulette on which keyboard pops up, though. Sometimes the stock keyboard, sometimes GBoard. It had a mind of its own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If the stock keyboard does pop up, it has no &amp;quot;slide typing&amp;quot; functionality. Seriously, how is this not a feature of the stock keyboard yet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you use a password manager, it is tied to the keyboard. Any password field would automatically launch the stock keyboard. This is just an extension of the annoyance of having &amp;quot;2 apps for every app&amp;quot; like I mentioned in the Apps section above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Camera/Photos

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The photos are significantly warmer than they are on the Pixel. This might be a matter of personal taste, but to me everything just looked so yellow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portrait mode struggles, a lot. I&amp;#39;ve only ever used portrait mode on the Pixel and it&amp;#39;s seamless. It seemed to really struggle with both humans and objects. I couldn&amp;#39;t understand why given that it has 3 cameras. I think it has something to do with the fact that it tries to show you a &amp;quot;live view&amp;quot; of what the portrait shot will look like.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Photos is a mess. The iPhone does not create separate folders for different types of photos, so there&amp;#39;s no way to tell Google Photos to back up only certain folders and do not back up others. You took a screenshot? Let&amp;#39;s start backing that up. Infuriating. Also, every single time you edit or delete a photo in Google Photos, you get a notification that asks for permission to perform the action, and you have to tap yes. Every, Single. Time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Background processes

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#39;s 2020. Why does Google Photos not back up my photos in the background? Why does Google Play Music not download my library in the background? In both cases, I had to leave my phone with the screen on and the app open. It was comical and I don&amp;#39;t understand why.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;iMessage/FaceTime

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;FaceTime was nice. iMessage was...OK? I&amp;#39;m a heavy WhatsApp user in the US so I didn&amp;#39;t really get the appeal of these. I will say that FaceTime&amp;#39;s moving heads and sizes constantly changing were a mess when doing group calls. Also, iMessage seems to lack the ability to &amp;quot;reply to&amp;quot; a message. For group messaging, this seems to be a huge oversight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The culmination of all of these little annoyances made it impossible for me to stick with the iPhone. Luckily I had not yet sold my Pixel 4, so I am back in business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I honestly always thought that iOS was good software, but some of their software decisions seriously had me scratching my head wondering who is making these choices at Apple. Some of these seem like simple, no-brainer choices that they won&amp;#39;t or can&amp;#39;t fix. Hope this helps anyone trying to decide whether they should try the other side. I still encourage people to give it a test run to see how you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"One weekend ago I wanted to test some specific custom phone ROMs out there but in the first stage I was prepared to do (potentially more destructive) tests only on the oldest Android phone I still have - a Samsung Note 3 N9005 from 2013.

So I went ahead and updated it to the latest Samsung stock (Android 5.0 from 2015 - before Samsung switched to 3 years of security updates for the flagships, old stuff but it was needed to be certain the phone has the latest baseband/modem and other separate firmware). Needless to say - security update was ancient and it was open to attacks like WiFi KRACK and probably tons of other newer attacks. Speed was not that great but that was to be expected for a device of that age.

Then I tested with two Android projects that sounded very cool - the very first one was [/e/  (formerly Eelo)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system\)), which is based on [LineageOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS) but with certain improvements for privacy and for a digital life where Google does not know everything about you. It was mentioned somehow recently in articles like [this](https://uk.pcmag.com/motorola-moto-z-play-droid/123158/hands-on-with-e-a-version-of-android-that-ditches-google) or [this](https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-e-google-free-pro-privacy-android-clone-is-now-available/) but also discussed [here](https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/e-foundation-first-look/) and [a response here](https://medium.com/hackernoon/leaving-apple-google-how-is-e-actually-google-free-1ba24e29efb9).

The install was in my experience simple enough (first of the above articles is saying it is not that easy, but perception of easy can be very different) and things started quite nicely, the phone was definitely snappier than with the Samsung stock firmware and all things I tested seemed to work fine. The experience was somehow limited since Google was kept outside it - on purpose.

And then I tried a more exotic project - [HavocOS 3.0](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-3/development/rom-havocos-3-0-t4000767) - a project based on Android 10 AOSP (with credits for LineageOS and a lot other projects) and ""inspired by Google Pixel"". The project has some excellent developers and maintainers - you can see those in the link above.

Installation is a little more complex (since it is an earlier beta and on Android 10 OpenGapps is still a moving target) but in the end things went fine installing BiTGApps as some people in the XDA forum were suggesting.

And this one was the special surprise - a few days back when I was playing with that I did have Android 10 with November 5 patch level on my Pixel 2XL but my (more recent) Note9 was on Android 9 November 1 patch level and the Poco F1 has only got the October 1 patch (also on Android 9). But the Note 3 from 6+ years ago now was also having Android 10 with November 5 patch level just like the Pixel, and a default launcher that was very much like the default Pixel launcher (which I normally replace with Apex Launcher Pro for consistency among all my phones, but on the Note3 I decided to give it a chance).

Anyway - long story short my ""old relict"" phone was now probably snappier than it ever was in the past (newer ART versions probably help) and on the latest security patch available to the public. It is almost as usable as any of my other phones from the signature (and in fairness with 3 GB RAM it is also the closest to the Pixel2XL from all my Android phones, all other Android phones have 6 GB RAM and that shows).

So why all this long story? Well, first of all to point that the level of updates in the normal commercial phones is a matter of commercial choice and not of technical choice - manufacturers try to support phones for the absolutely minimal amount of time they can get away with, and for the people that are not prepared to live unprotected the easy choice is just to upgrade to the latest (usually expensive) phone.

The other reason is to point to the fact that the Samsung Note3 has a removable battery (it is not even the last Note to have that, the Note4 is). And that means that the phone could probably last on open-source Android projects with up-to-date security for as long as I can still find a replacement for the batteries - which unfortunately in itself no longer seems so easy, most of what I could find was inexpensive stuff of dubious quality. But the point remains - good phones could vastly outlast the ""planned obsolescence"" built into them, but in the absence of significant regulation this ""planned obsolescence"" will just continue to creep-in and contribute to the increased amount of technological waste and pollution around us.

EDIT:

I forgot to add two links that I had saved for this post - not affiliated in any way with either one. First - if you are serious about security you might want to take a look at /r/GrapheneOS/. And if you missed this (good) video - [here](https://youtu.be/ByCDKBBhdZg) Dave Lee makes the point that (at least some) Apple phones ""age"" better - that is probably true with ""stock software"" but as this test points out it is a result of dubious software policies from Android manufacturers and not from anything intrinsic to Android itself.",t2_5jodg,False,,0,False,Smartphones after 6+ years and other things that manufacturers don't like people to know,[],r/Android,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_e4l01q,False,dark,0.93,,public,2343,0,{},,ac07c8fe-ff93-11e0-9fdc-12313d192a33,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2343,,False,self,1575288768.0,userBlue,[],{},self,,True,,1575252391.0,text,6,,,text,self.Android,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;One weekend ago I wanted to test some specific custom phone ROMs out there but in the first stage I was prepared to do (potentially more destructive) tests only on the oldest Android phone I still have - a Samsung Note 3 N9005 from 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went ahead and updated it to the latest Samsung stock (Android 5.0 from 2015 - before Samsung switched to 3 years of security updates for the flagships, old stuff but it was needed to be certain the phone has the latest baseband/modem and other separate firmware). Needless to say - security update was ancient and it was open to attacks like WiFi KRACK and probably tons of other newer attacks. Speed was not that great but that was to be expected for a device of that age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I tested with two Android projects that sounded very cool - the very first one was &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki//e/_(operating_system)""&gt;/e/  (formerly Eelo)&lt;/a&gt;, which is based on &lt;a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LineageOS""&gt;LineageOS&lt;/a&gt; but with certain improvements for privacy and for a digital life where Google does not know everything about you. It was mentioned somehow recently in articles like &lt;a href=""https://uk.pcmag.com/motorola-moto-z-play-droid/123158/hands-on-with-e-a-version-of-android-that-ditches-google""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://www.zdnet.com/article/the-e-google-free-pro-privacy-android-clone-is-now-available/""&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; but also discussed &lt;a href=""https://infosec-handbook.eu/blog/e-foundation-first-look/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://medium.com/hackernoon/leaving-apple-google-how-is-e-actually-google-free-1ba24e29efb9""&gt;a response here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"Just a heads up the ""Fab Wallpapers"" app which is currently ranked #24 on the app charts is serving Facebook phishing popups and other malware.

The app has permissions to ""retrieve running apps"" and when you install it and then start using Facebook you will get a popup that looks to be from Facebook asking you to re-login. 

This is a phishing advert that then steals your Facebook login information. (Doesn't happen straight away but if you read 1* reviews on the app they all mention similar things - https://i.imgur.com/ROZtwTQ.jpg)

I know because this happened to my mum earlier so I'm making you all aware.

Once the Facebook account is compromised it shares spam affiliate posts and tags all your friends. Funny thing is, if you check the apps author it's ""MLM Hub"", funny ""coincidence"" when the spam posts promote multi level marketing programs.

,Android,"Just a heads up that if you switch phones, it's a good idea to turn off RCS on the old phone first. If RCS isn't yet enabled on your new phone (or it's an iPhone), messages from contacts in existing RCS chats may potentially continue to go to your old phone. 

I got caught with this yesterday actually - switched my SIM from my Pixel to my iPhone. Missed a bunch of messages from my wife during the day because they were still going to my Pixel. 

Note that my Pixel was still on and connected to Wifi - if it wasn't, the 'Resend undelivered as SMS' option that is enabled by default might have worked, but [Google support](https://support.google.com/messages/answer/7189714?hl=en) also suggests turning off RCS as it may stay active for up to 8 days.

Fortunately it's not as bad as iMessage was a couple years ago where you had to tell people to delete their existing group chats and put your phone number into Apple's site to deregister it.

This is a music player running Android Pie. I bought it for its intended use as well as for the cassette Walkman look. It has WiFi, Bluetooth, and the Play Store. So you can install essentially any Android app to it. Internal memory is 16 GB, but there is a microSD slot available. And, obviously, a headphone jack. There are full media controls on the side, and a Hold button for them.

There is no skin on the OS apart from a few custom apps. There is also a music volume separate from the media volume. And, most importantly for me, there is a screen that lets you force LDAC 990 kbps, or every other supported Bluetooth audio codec.

Hi XXX, 

Greetings from Mi India Customer Support and sharing the screenshots with us. I am Divya and I understand that you want to remove clean master from all Indian phone variants running MIUI. Also, you want to know about the updates for the same in your POCO F1. 

We apologize for the inconvenience caused to you.
Please do not worry, I will assist you with it.

I would like to inform you that you will get an update for a cleaner app, the new version is 4.1.2 which will take care of the removing extension Clean master. These updates will be pushed via system updater.

Also, as the Security app in MIUI phones used uses plug-in/definition of Clean Master which is one among the 59 apps banned by Indian Govt. We are not using the Clean Master app directly instead the service is used in the name of Cleaner under the Security app. Hence, users don’t have an option to uninstall Clean Master. So, Xiaomi is pushing a Soft Update (Update happens in the background without any notification) to remove the Clean Master Service from the Security app.

Once the update is automatically applied, our users will continue to see the Cleaner section in the Security app but it will not be the one from Clean Master instead it will use Xiaomi’s own Cleaning definition.

I hope the provided information will help you. If you have any further queries, please feel free to contact us.

Regards,
Divya

This didn’t sit well with me, considering at least some of its users are paying customers.  In theory, we should get *better* treatment from Google, not worse. So over the course of a few hours, I moved the major parts of my entire Google existence going back 12 years from GSuite to a free, regular old Gmail account. I commented on a thread about this and someone asked me how I did it, so I thought I’d spell it out. I hoping to help folks and maybe discuss better ways to get it done.

&amp;#x200B;

**Foreword**

This is just what I did. Your mileage may vary. Do your due diligence before messing with important data. Don’t delete anything until you know it’s safely backed up or on the new account.

Before starting, I want to point you to Google Takeout. I highly recommend using this service to download and save everything you can to somewhere safe. It takes forever, but makes parts of the process easier and at the very least, provides some peace of mind.

&amp;#x200B;

**Pros**

* Full Google Assistant and Google Home functionality.
* Saves money if you pay for your GSuite account.
* No risk that your employer will cut you off from your account.
* Can leave Play Store app reviews.
* Custom dictionaries for Google Keyboard are saved to the cloud, if you don't have a GSuite account installed on your phone. Thanks /u/alpain.

&amp;#x200B;

**Cons**

* This is a lot of work.
* You’ll lose your search history, online reviews and Local Guide status, music play counts, Google Assistant home control routines, minimal Google scanning of your files, and no free 150TB of storage.
* You’ll lose your Google Rewards, ~~but you can use them to buy a Play Store gift card, which might be better.~~  but you can use an app called Convert King to convert them to PayPal dollars.
* I lost my $8/month Google Play Music rate, and now have to pay $12/month for YouTube Premium (which gives me GPM for free).
* You might have to tell everyone a new email address, unless you keep the old one.

&amp;#x200B;

**Email**

I didn’t want to just forward every email in my GSuite account to the new account. That would take forever, and be messy.

Google doesn’t provide an easy way to transfer your emails from a GSuite account to a regular email account, so I used Mozilla Thunderbird as an intermediate step. Add both of your accounts, and import your entire inbox into Thunderbird. Once the emails are read into Thunderbird, which took me two hours, you can right click on each folder and select “Copy to…” to send it to the other account. Very handy, and free.

After that was done, I set up IMAP checking of the old account, which conveniently pulls emails over. I also added the GSuite account info to the regular Gmail account settings, so I can select which account I want to send emails from (since I haven’t deleted my GSuite account yet).

&amp;#x200B;

**Contacts**

Use the Export function on the left of the page to save your contacts to a Google CSV file, swap to the new account, and import the file.  I think you lose contact pictures in this process, so there might be a better way to do it.

&amp;#x200B;

**Calendar**

Settings &gt; Import &amp; Export to a file, swap to the new account, and import the file.

&amp;#x200B;

**Hangouts**

I’m one of the last remaining humans still using this utterly lame platform. Some conversations were priceless to me and I wanted to keep them, so Takeout made that pretty easy.  Unfortunately, it saves your conversation as JSON files, which aren't easy to read or import elsewhere, so I used the free decoder found by Jay2K1... this tool was really helpful.

I switched over to a better non-Google platform during the big migration, since there’s no way to import Hangouts discussions from a new account.

&amp;#x200B;

**Photos**

I thought this was going to be the end of the world, but Google actually made transferring 10 years’ worth of pictures pretty easy. Just share your pictures, albums, etc. to the new account and they’ll show up in your new account. Once you see them all, select them all and do a “save to library” to make them yours on the new account. Beware: if you’re like me and have a ton of photos on there, it takes a long time to populate. During the process, I was worried that dates and locations seemed to be wrong, but that all fixed itself by the time it was done.  Just be patient.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Play Music**

Before I tell you what I did, you should look into the app Soundiiz I mention below.  I didn't know about it when I transferred my GPM collection, and I wish I did.

I have an extensive music library on Google Play Music, so this was a huge concern for me. Doing this the hard way meant making a long list of artists, songs, and albums in my collection and individually adding them into the new account. Screw that.

The Share functionality was very useful for this. For each playlist, I shared it to the new account. Swap to the new account, accept the share, select all, and do an “add to library.”

But what about several thousand songs in my library that weren’t in playlists? I certainly didn’t want to select thousands of songs and individually share them over, so I made new playlists that contains my entire music collection. For example, I made a playlist with all of the songs I'd given a thumbs up, so those would be preserved.  A complication is that Google only allows 500 songs in a playlist, so I had to make like 12 new playlists. It was a pain in the ass, but it got the job done.

Another complication is uploaded music.  Back in the day, I had to upload a lot of music to GPM because it didn't exist in their library.  Today, not one song wasn't available in GPM.  This took a while, but I went through my entire collection and took note of everything I had uploaded, then added each song to my library.  If you have uploaded music that isn't in the GPM library, you might look into whether Google Takeout will download them, then swap accounts and re-upload them.

&amp;#x200B;

**YouTube**

This one was tough without help. I don’t have a lot of uploaded videos, so that part was easy: just upload the originals to the new account. If you don't have the originals, Google Takeout will download them from the old account for you.  Sure, I lost views and comments, but that’s a bonus in my opinion. Clearly, if you’re a content provider, this part might be a deal-breaker.

Playlists and subscriptions were a different story. To transfer playlists, I used app called Soundiiz, which is $4.50/month, to transfer playlists from the old account to the new one.  I used that service for a few hours and then cancelled the service. It was well worth the five bucks.

There’s no way to transfer subscriptions, so I had to manually enter those. I opened two windows side-by-side and went down the list. I have about 20, so it really only took about 5 minutes to search for a provider and click the subscribe button.

/u/F5PPu6kGqj reports that YouTube subscriptions can be exported (but maybe not imported) from with [YouTube Subscription Manager](https://www.youtube.com/subscription_manager).

&amp;#x200B;

**YouTube Music**

This service is such a train wreck that I almost didn’t bother. The aforementioned Soundiiz app transferred my songs from one account to the other, but a decent number of them showed up on the new account as videos of live performances or covers by crappy bands. I attribute this to the YTM library being much, much smaller than the Google Play Music library, so it had no choice than to downgrade to whatever video it could find. Beware: you’ll have to spend some time deleting these misidentifications, because some of them are really, really bad.

&amp;#x200B;

**Maps**

You’ll have to set up home and work locations in your new account… no big deal. For saved locations, you can use the Share function to send them to your new account, and manually save each one. I only had half a dozen, so this was easy for me. If you have a lot of them, I haven’t tried this but you can probably make a map of all of them and share the entire map.

&amp;#x200B;

**Keep lists**

Keep lists are shareable, but if you delete them on the original account, they get deleted on all shared accounts. You can copy and paste from one note to another, but that is a lot of work. An easy way to do this is share each list to your new account, then switch to your new account and they’ll all be there waiting for you. Select each one and choose Make a Copy, and that list will belong to you. You can delete the old list at this point.

&amp;#x200B;

**Web Passwords**

You can export your web site passwords stored in Chrome by going to Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Passwords &gt; dot menu to the right of ""Saved Passwords"" &gt; Export Passwords.  After you switch to your new account, you can import from that file back into Chrome with Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Import Bookmarks and Settings and select Bookmarks HTML file from the pulldown.

&amp;#x200B;

**Bookmarks**

I saved off my bookmarks to a file using Google Takeout. Most web browsers have an import/export functionality. I’m dumb and use Chrome, so I used Settings &gt; Bookmarks &gt; Bookmark Manager &gt; dot menu &gt; Export to save them to a file.After you switch to your new account, you can import from that file back into Chrome with Menu &gt; Settings &gt; Import Bookmarks and Settings &gt; navigate to saved file.

&amp;#x200B;

**2FA**

To the best of my knowledge, Google Authenticate doesn't provide any means to switch to new accounts, or any backup capability.  You'll have to turn off 2FA for each account and reconnect it on your new account.

I use Authy for 2-factor authentication, for exactly this reason; Authy allows you to change email addresses. It’s a process that you should take very seriously, but it’s straight-forward and doesn’t take too long. Everything transferred with no issues.

&amp;#x200B;

**Apps**

This was a bitter pill to swallow because I had a lot of paid apps accumulated over the years. I could live without many of them, but a few are super important to me and had to be purchased again. For free apps, I opened two browser windows, one with each account logged into the Play Store, and manually went down the list.  I use a lot of apps, but this was pretty easy and only took about half an hour to search for each one and tell it to install.  For paid apps, like I said, you’re just going to have to buy them again. I didn’t bother contacting the app authors; they’re under no obligation to help us out, but you might be able to convince them.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Drive files**

I have about 50 files on my Google Drive. I used the Share function to move these over. It was pretty easy because you can share entire folders.  Once they're accessible on your new account, right click and select Make a Copy.  That will make the file belong to your new account and you can delete the old one.  This should work for all Google Docs and Sheets documents you have online.

&amp;#x200B;

**Google Voice voicemails**

You can associate your GV number with a new Google account, but you can’t bring your saved voicemails or SMS messages with you. I used Google Takeout to download them all for safe keeping before I initiated the swap to the new account. There’s no way to upload them to GV once it’s linked to the new account, so I just keep them on a hard drive now.

&amp;#x200B;

* Thanks for the upvotes and coinage!
* Added a link to Convert King, which lets you convert Google Rewards money to PayPal.
* Added a link to YouTube Subscription Manager.

&lt;p&gt;There was an update for the app, now the storage cleaner by 360 got removed. They also updated the images so it fits to the Android 10 version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Changelog:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ Android 10 ]
- Android 10 is now supported.
- The look of the Battery usage page has been improved.
- Some bugs have been fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ Android 9 ]

,Android,"At this point, no fancy hardware feature, no Android system update, no stock-like ROM or anything you can imagine will ever bring your experience on Android to the next level. We've nearly reached the limit and everyone knows it. Improvements are extremely incremental and largely don't change how you interact with your device on a day-to-day basis.

Your time on the lock screen, the home screen, looking at the notification shade, tweaking a few niche settings to your likings; those are small moments in time. What you look at and use large and by far *are the apps themselves.*

With all that in mind, I think it's absolutely ridiculous that mainstream tech reviewers continue to harp on the same strings:

* xx GBs of RAM
* 8xx Snapdragon with +7% of performance you'll never see or use
* Screen body ratio
* etc

All this while arguably the most important piece of the puzzle is ignored. 

When mainstream reviewers are doing (for example) their showdown comparisons of the latest iPhone vs the Samsung, iPhone vs the Pixel, etc, they should be mentioning that a good portion of the Android apps are absolute dogshit. Call them out specifically such as Snapchat, Instagram &amp; Facebook. They should of course acknowledge that it's not the phone manufacturers fault, but really start giving the heat to these huge mega corporations for their continually awful treatment of Android users. I pay the same monthly bill as an iOS user on Spotify for half the experience.

On top of inserting it into occasional reviews, (which is fair as they should be reviewing the overall experience, not just listing specs and first impressions) they should also be writing articles about it. Make some noise about it. I'm aware that a few have been written in the past, but they've all gotten very quiet about it in the past years and it's helping nobody. 

If mainstream reviewers continue to shout ""If only my phone had 2 more GB of RAM! If only my screen was 0.2"" larger!"" then that's all we're going to get. Ever.

On the other hand, if the awful app experience starts to generate bad press to everyone involved, who knows, companies like Google &amp; Samsung might even take initiative to cooperate with app developers to create a better experience. Snapchat might eventually snap &amp; officially support select flagships for stock-app-like camera quality. Same with Instagram &amp; Facebook. Beyond camera quality, Samsung &amp; Google might start giving out some ... *ahem* ""incentives"" for major app devs to clean up their act.

Windows Phones were absolutely crucified for their app support. I don't know why Android seems to be getting a free pass. I'm a huge Android fanboy, and I think the only way things are going to improve is if the people with a real voice in the tech community start putting it through the ringer.

[Update Post](https://reddit.com/r/Android/comments/dtx84u/androids_gmail_notification_bug_or_is_it_update/)

So some of you may have had delayed notifications on Gmail and I believe this is concrete proof that something within Android's messaging system is faulty.

I tried every ""fix"" out there and knew deep inside that there is something wrong with something deep within the OS. 
Why would a push notification not work for GMail but works for everything else? 
Why do I need to remove battery optimization? It's a push notification and every other app registers them successfully.
So, I thought, why not factory reset the phone and see if that fixes it. Nope.

So I did what every IT person does and starts looking at the logs.

I sent myself an email at 08:13 from an Office 365 email account obviously and waited. After 10 minutes of no notification, here are the results:

As you can see from the [image ](https://i.imgur.com/VN1ruSY.png) Gmail (aka [bigtop](https://www.androidpolice.com/2014/10/21/rumor-a-project-codenamed-bigtop-will-be-googles-new-task-oriented-email-system/) ) sends a push notification, on time, at 8:13, exactly when it arrived in my mailbox. However, something within Android, maybe GMS does not, for the lack of a better term, acknowledge it. Another arrives 30 seconds later. The system again ignores it.

As soon as I unlock the phone, the alert arrives saying 10 mins. So I look at the logs and as you can see at 08:24 it did a pull and shows the notification.

So I tested again and sent an email at 10:09 and waited. After 6 minutes of no notification, I run another [FCM diagnostic](https://i.imgur.com/v069NpG.png)

Push notification arrives on time and the notification system ignores it and doesn't show the notification. But when I unlock the phone, the phone does a GMS pull and shows the notification.

So, to everyone thinking that this is a battery optimization issue, this is evidence that it is not. The bugs are not in the apps. The bug is in the OS/FCM/GMS or whatever.

To run the same diagnostic, go to your phone app and dial 

    *#*#426#*#*

Send yourself test emails and share the results.

,Android,"First I want to give credit to the earlier [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/haraqv/hey_google_im_being_pulled_over/) and all that's been said there as well as the original creator of that tutorial.

This tutorial below will create a more complete shortcut that will do the following:

1. Send a text message to your designated contacts with a message and your current GPS location via Google Maps link
2. Record video while the phone is locked
3. Upload the recorded videos automatically to Google Drive or other cloud service
4. Share the cloud folder of recorded videos with your designated contacts
5. Run all this while the phone is in [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) mode

&amp;#x200B;

**The basic function is to allow you to record video while the phone is in** [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) **mode. This has obvious benefits over a screen with brightness set to 0.** This will provide more robust function than the similar iOS shortcut ""I'm being pulled over"" which also just sets the screen brightness to 0.

&amp;#x200B;

Apps you will need:

1. [Nova Launcher](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;hl=en_CA)
2. [Quick Video Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kimcy929.secretvideorecorder&amp;hl=en_CA)
3. [Tasker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;hl=en_CA) or [Automate](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llamalab.automate&amp;hl=en_CA) (there should be other apps that can work as well)
4. Cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc)
5. [Cloud auto sync app](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=autosync&amp;c=apps&amp;hl=en_CA)

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 1**: Make sure [Lockdown](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/) mode is enabled on your phone

Open your phones Settings app, navigate to the **Security &amp; Location** option. Tap **Lock Screen Preferences** and toggle on **Show Lockdown Option** from the list.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 2**: Configure Quick Video Recorder

* In Settings, you have plenty of customization on how you want the app to work. Most importantly, make sure to disable battery optimizations and to set a recording time/size limit. This allows the app to automatically end recordings so the files can be uploaded automatically. You can also allow recordings to repeat automatically if you need video recording for longer.
* Toggle ""Enable Do Not Disturb while recording"" to On
* Scroll down in Settings to Shortcut Settings, and create a Front Camera Shortcut or Back Camera Shortcut or both. This will put an Activity shortcut on your homescreen. If it doesn't, you will need to dig through Nova Launcher gestures to confirm the shortcut is created.
* Click on the shortcut to test the app works.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 3**: Configure your cloud service to auto sync the video folder

* By default your videos will be recorded to the folder QuickVideoRecorder
* Follow the instructions of the cloud sync app to auto sync this folder. It would be better to enable the option to detect new files automatically and upload them
* Make sure to enable the app to auto sync over mobile data and while the phone is plugged in and on battery. This should not cause much battery drain if at all since it will only upload files if there's a new file added to the folder. 
* If there's any paid limitations like file size, consider paying to remove those limitations or finding a free app to do the same sync function

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 4**: Share your cloud folder with your designated contacts

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 5**: Configure your automation app

Now this part gets tricky depending on which you want to use. I will use Tasker as an example, but I'm sure that this can be done with Automate and other apps as well.

1. Open Tasker, go to Tasks tab, create new Task
2. Add Shortcut (+ Button &gt; App &gt; Shortcut) &gt; press the magnifying glass icon next to Shortcut &gt; Nova Launcher: Activities &gt; Quick Video Recorder &gt; Front camera shortcut. Save the task with label if needed
3. Add Location parse (+ button &gt; Location &gt; Get Location v2). Back out to Task Edit
4. Add Send SMS (+ button &gt; Phone &gt; Send SMS)
   1. Number: Use magnifying glass icon at Number to find your designated contacts
   2. Message: I'm being pulled over %gl\_map\_url   or some other message with  %gl\_map\_url at the end
   3. Add label if needed, and go back to Task Edit
5. Add System Lock (+ Button &gt; Display &gt; System Lock)
6. Press the Play button on the bottom left to test your task. If everything works, your phone should execute each of these tasks in sequence. Make sure to enable permissions as needed
7. Select an icon for your task by clicking the icon with multiple boxes next to the + button
8. Create an app out of the task you just created:
   1. Back to Tasker home screen, find the task you created in Tasks tab
   2. Press and hold the task
   3. Expand the context menu and Export &gt; As App
   4. You will be asked to download [Tasker App Factory](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory&amp;hl=en_CA)
   5. In Package section, enter a random sequence of letters with a . in between (ie: oisjf.sidfwei)
   6. Install the app by allowing Tasker the necessary permissions as well as allowing the app to be installed and bypass Google Play protection. This is safe since you are making your own app
9. You will find a new app installed on your phone with the same name as your task
10. Test the new app. The first time you will need to enable a bunch of permissions.

&amp;#x200B;

**Step 6**: Integrate into Google Assistant

\*Note there may be limitations depending on if your Android device allows you to trigger Google Assistant while the phone is locked. This step is therefore optional and you can just use the newly created Tasker app manually.

1. Open Google Assistant settings from Settings app or by asking ""Ok Google, open Google Assistant settings"" and open your profile icon on top right
2. Open Assistant tab
3. Scroll down to Routines
4. Add a routine
5. Under ""Add commands"", add your trigger phrase ""I'm being pulled over"" or whatever you want your phrase to be
6. Press + Add action
7. Under Enter command, type in Open -name of your Tasker app-  (ie: Open Pulled Over)
8. Save
9. Make sure that your Google Assistant can be triggered while your phone is locked. Here's a link to instructions on how to do this. [Link](https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/439605?hl=en)

**Done**

&amp;#x200B;

If Google Assistant is not working well or your phone does not support Google Assistant triggering or some other limitation, consider a simple Nova Launcher gesture shortcut to activate your Tasker app or shortcut that records video and puts phone in Lockdown mode. For example, two finger swipe up to turn on Front Camera Shortcut activity and two finger swipe down to Screen Lock (make sure to give Nova Launcher admin permissions to use Screen Lock shortcut).

&amp;#x200B;

**Important**: As mentioned above, the confusing Tasker bit and implementing with Google Assistant is very much optional. It's here to create a seamless flow of events triggered by your voice. But if your Android phone has weird integration with Google Assistant or it won't trigger while locked, it could get annoying. You'll also need to unlock your device for Google Assistant to trigger an app, requiring you to have an easily accessible fingerprint scanner or face unlock.

**Remember, reliability is key.** If it doesn't reliably work, you're better off using the Front Camera Shortcut/Back Camera Shortcut directly and then putting your phone in Lockdown mode. Or using the Nova Launcher gestures example above.

There's more actions you can add to this as well, such as turning off music, sending periodic GPS location pings, etc. If you're rooted there's probably a whole bunch of crazy things you can do. Tinker at will.

&amp;#x200B;

The process is more complicated than a simple Google Assistant routine but this is probably the most feature rich implementation of this idea. Keep in mind there are obvious limitations to this shortcut such as your phone runs out of battery, the SIM card is removed, etc.

As far as installation it is possible to simply export the Tasker task APK and allow people to install it. For the sake of being as trustless as possible, I hope you will make your own apps instead.

I created this separate post because I didn't want all this to get buried in the comments section. It's also a bit long to dig through as a comment post.

As said in the other thread, make sure to abide by the law and [know your rights](https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/stopped-by-police/).",t2_6jyq5caq,False,,0,False,"A more complete shortcut for ""Hey Google, I'm being pulled over"" for Android devices",[],r/Android,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_hc6ry4,False,dark,0.92,,public,1554,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1554,,False,self,1592619742.0,,[],{},,,True,,1592622661.0,text,6,,,text,self.Android,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First I want to give credit to the earlier &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/haraqv/hey_google_im_being_pulled_over/""&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; and all that&amp;#39;s been said there as well as the original creator of that tutorial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tutorial below will create a more complete shortcut that will do the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Send a text message to your designated contacts with a message and your current GPS location via Google Maps link&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Record video while the phone is locked&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Upload the recorded videos automatically to Google Drive or other cloud service&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share the cloud folder of recorded videos with your designated contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run all this while the phone is in &lt;a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/""&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt; mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The basic function is to allow you to record video while the phone is in&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/""&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;mode. This has obvious benefits over a screen with brightness set to 0.&lt;/strong&gt; This will provide more robust function than the similar iOS shortcut &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m being pulled over&amp;quot; which also just sets the screen brightness to 0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apps you will need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teslacoilsw.launcher&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Nova Launcher&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kimcy929.secretvideorecorder&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Quick Video Recorder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.taskerm&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Tasker&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.llamalab.automate&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Automate&lt;/a&gt; (there should be other apps that can work as well)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cloud service (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/search?q=autosync&amp;amp;c=apps&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Cloud auto sync app&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure &lt;a href=""https://www.androidauthority.com/android-pie-lockdown-security-924466/""&gt;Lockdown&lt;/a&gt; mode is enabled on your phone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open your phones Settings app, navigate to the &lt;strong&gt;Security &amp;amp; Location&lt;/strong&gt; option. Tap &lt;strong&gt;Lock Screen Preferences&lt;/strong&gt; and toggle on &lt;strong&gt;Show Lockdown Option&lt;/strong&gt; from the list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Configure Quick Video Recorder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Settings, you have plenty of customization on how you want the app to work. Most importantly, make sure to disable battery optimizations and to set a recording time/size limit. This allows the app to automatically end recordings so the files can be uploaded automatically. You can also allow recordings to repeat automatically if you need video recording for longer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Toggle &amp;quot;Enable Do Not Disturb while recording&amp;quot; to On&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scroll down in Settings to Shortcut Settings, and create a Front Camera Shortcut or Back Camera Shortcut or both. This will put an Activity shortcut on your homescreen. If it doesn&amp;#39;t, you will need to dig through Nova Launcher gestures to confirm the shortcut is created.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click on the shortcut to test the app works.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Configure your cloud service to auto sync the video folder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By default your videos will be recorded to the folder QuickVideoRecorder&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Follow the instructions of the cloud sync app to auto sync this folder. It would be better to enable the option to detect new files automatically and upload them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure to enable the app to auto sync over mobile data and while the phone is plugged in and on battery. This should not cause much battery drain if at all since it will only upload files if there&amp;#39;s a new file added to the folder. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there&amp;#39;s any paid limitations like file size, consider paying to remove those limitations or finding a free app to do the same sync function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Share your cloud folder with your designated contacts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 5&lt;/strong&gt;: Configure your automation app&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this part gets tricky depending on which you want to use. I will use Tasker as an example, but I&amp;#39;m sure that this can be done with Automate and other apps as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open Tasker, go to Tasks tab, create new Task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Shortcut (+ Button &amp;gt; App &amp;gt; Shortcut) &amp;gt; press the magnifying glass icon next to Shortcut &amp;gt; Nova Launcher: Activities &amp;gt; Quick Video Recorder &amp;gt; Front camera shortcut. Save the task with label if needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Location parse (+ button &amp;gt; Location &amp;gt; Get Location v2). Back out to Task Edit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add Send SMS (+ button &amp;gt; Phone &amp;gt; Send SMS)

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Number: Use magnifying glass icon at Number to find your designated contacts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Message: I&amp;#39;m being pulled over %gl_map_url   or some other message with  %gl_map_url at the end&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add label if needed, and go back to Task Edit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add System Lock (+ Button &amp;gt; Display &amp;gt; System Lock)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the Play button on the bottom left to test your task. If everything works, your phone should execute each of these tasks in sequence. Make sure to enable permissions as needed&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Select an icon for your task by clicking the icon with multiple boxes next to the + button&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create an app out of the task you just created:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back to Tasker home screen, find the task you created in Tasks tab&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press and hold the task&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expand the context menu and Export &amp;gt; As App&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You will be asked to download &lt;a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.dinglisch.android.appfactory&amp;amp;hl=en_CA""&gt;Tasker App Factory&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Package section, enter a random sequence of letters with a . in between (ie: oisjf.sidfwei)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the app by allowing Tasker the necessary permissions as well as allowing the app to be installed and bypass Google Play protection. This is safe since you are making your own app&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Test the new app. The first time you will need to enable a bunch of permissions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 6&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrate into Google Assistant&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*Note there may be limitations depending on if your Android device allows you to trigger Google Assistant while the phone is locked. This step is therefore optional and you can just use the newly created Tasker app manually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Add a routine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under &amp;quot;Add commands&amp;quot;, add your trigger phrase &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m being pulled over&amp;quot; or whatever you want your phrase to be&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press + Add action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Under Enter command, type in Open -name of your Tasker app-  (ie: Open Pulled Over)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Save&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that your Google Assistant can be triggered while your phone is locked. Here&amp;#39;s a link to instructions on how to do this. &lt;a href=""https://support.google.com/assistant/thread/439605?hl=en""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Done&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"I've just finished building a small tool called [symbit](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit) which helps with rooting and updating of existing rooted devices. With Android 10, some TWRP versions have not been updated to support the new /system partition format and do not work for those devices. This tool aims to solve the issue by making it easier to root and update existing rooted Android devices.

[Source code](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit)

[README](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit/blob/master/README.md)

[Download Links](https://github.com/raphtlw/symbit#install)

My original motivation to create this was when my friend asked me for help updating his Pixel 3 XL. Due to the fact that TWRP does not support Android 10 on the Pixel, I had to tell him to use the manual updating method which involved typing many commands to update the system and patching the boot.img file via Magisk. I decided then to create this small utility to help him and (hopefully) someone else who may have difficulties rooting/updating their rooted device.

In future when I (hopefully) have more time to work on this, it will support running without a PC and directly on Android itself through termux.

,Android,"Hello /r/android,

We've been redesigning a bit the VLC/Android application for the next release.

We've moved to bottom navigation for Android 9/10/11 compatibility, are getting closer to Material guidelines and added a lot more UI tricks and animations to feel more native.

We'd love to hear feedback so that we can improve before the final 3.3.0.

**METHOD**

I've been learning about natural language processing over the last couple of months, and thought this would be fun project.

I trained a convolutional neural network on sentiment analysis using Amazon reviews from the ""Cell Phones and Accessories"" category. The mean score of these reviews was \~4.2, so I chose to mark scores &gt;= 4 as positive and &lt; 4 as negative. I then trained the neural network on these reviews, until it could consistently predict what a good (4 or 5 star) or a bad (1, 2 or 3 star) review looked like, just given the review's text.

The trained model will produce a value near to 1 given the text of a positive review and 0 given a negative review. Once it was trained on the Amazon reviews, I applied it to reddit comments.


To reduce the number of comments that I would need to test on, I only downloaded comments which contained one or more of the manufacturer's names. This has the downside of eliminating comments that didn't explicitly mention a brand even if it was obviously referenced (""Samsung Galaxy S8"" vs ""Galaxy S8""). This also is a problem if a comment contains more than one name eg

&gt;I hate how iOS is so restricted. I wish Apple would allow us to set default apps, like Google.

In this case, the low sentiment score would be added to both Apple and Google's results, even though Google wasn't the target of the comment's negativity.


Each plotted point is the week's average. I don't think the results are accurate [given how noisy the raw data was](https://imgur.com/i7lliLF) and the [varying amounts of data for each OEM](https://imgur.com/SDP0R8N), but overall trends are consistent with my own predictions.

It's often suggested that Apple is liked more than any other manufacturer on /r/Android, and that does seem to be the case -- the iPhone 11 launch is the greatest maximum point on the graph, though I was expecting more of a drop with the iPhone 7. Samsung's stagnating line was a surprise and may be due to the high prices of recent flagships. Somewhat predictably, the sub's perception of Google is the only one heading consistently downhill given the poor reaction to the Pixel line and other Google products.

I also collected data for Huawei, HTC and Xiaomi but didn't include them in the main results as the number of comments for each seemed too small for a fair comparison. [Here is the graph with them included](https://imgur.com/54dTkN5).  


Again, these findings shouldn't be taken seriously as I'm not using a state-of-the-art model and the comment selection process was as basic as it could get, but hopefully it was interesting for some of you.

&lt;p&gt;To reduce the number of comments that I would need to test on, I only downloaded comments which contained one or more of the manufacturer&amp;#39;s names. This has the downside of eliminating comments that didn&amp;#39;t explicitly mention a brand even if it was obviously referenced (&amp;quot;Samsung Galaxy S8&amp;quot; vs &amp;quot;Galaxy S8&amp;quot;). This also is a problem if a comment contains more than one name eg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hate how iOS is so restricted. I wish Apple would allow us to set default apps, like Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this case, the low sentiment score would be added to both Apple and Google&amp;#39;s results, even though Google wasn&amp;#39;t the target of the comment&amp;#39;s negativity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each plotted point is the week&amp;#39;s average. I don&amp;#39;t think the results are accurate &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/i7lliLF""&gt;given how noisy the raw data was&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/SDP0R8N""&gt;varying amounts of data for each OEM&lt;/a&gt;, but overall trends are consistent with my own predictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s often suggested that Apple is liked more than any other manufacturer on &lt;a href=""/r/Android""&gt;/r/Android&lt;/a&gt;, and that does seem to be the case -- the iPhone 11 launch is the greatest maximum point on the graph, though I was expecting more of a drop with the iPhone 7. Samsung&amp;#39;s stagnating line was a surprise and may be due to the high prices of recent flagships. Somewhat predictably, the sub&amp;#39;s perception of Google is the only one heading consistently downhill given the poor reaction to the Pixel line and other Google products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also collected data for Huawei, HTC and Xiaomi but didn&amp;#39;t include them in the main results as the number of comments for each seemed too small for a fair comparison. &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/54dTkN5""&gt;Here is the graph with them included&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, these findings shouldn&amp;#39;t be taken seriously as I&amp;#39;m not using a state-of-the-art model and the comment selection process was as basic as it could get, but hopefully it was interesting for some of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Added colourblind graph; attempted to improve explanation of method; increased line thickness&lt;/p&gt;

I was able to get it to work by downloading an app that can force any app into Wide Mode.

,Android,"Last year, I was in the market for a new tablet. Since I was already in the Android/Samsung ecosystem, and my girlfriend already has the iPad Pro, I took the bullet and bought the Galaxy Tab S6. Here is my in-depth review after using it for about 8 months:

# Display

This is the highlight of this device. I will say it: The **Galaxy Tab S6 has the best looking \~10"" display you can get on any device today**. It's vivid, contrasty, bright, and has excellent viewing angles. The main advantage is the fact that it's a large version of the AMOLED panel used on Samsung's flagship phones. I have the new MacBook Pro 13"", iPad Pro and a Galaxy S10 to compare, and I can't think of a better device to watch movies or play games than the Tab S6. It doesn't have the 120hz refresh rate of the iPad Pro, but for my use case of watching Netflix, reading eBooks, and playing some popular games (CoD Mobile, PUBG, Asphalt), all of which fall under 60fps, this 60hz AMOLED display wins over a 120hz LCD display. For more latency-sensitive use like drawing, and playing certain games, then the iPad Pro has an advantage. Worth mentioning that the Tab S7 that's right around the corner, will likely have 120hz support as well.

# Speaker

The Tab S6 comes with a quad-speaker set up. It's loud, clear, and balanced. It's better than my (gf's) iPad Pro (2019) and almost as good as my MacBook Pro 13 speaker (which is regarded as having one of the best speakers for a laptop). Listening to music, watching movies or gaming is quite enjoyable on these. The speaker also seems to change its audio profile/direction depending on your screen rotation dynamically.

# Design

The design is premium and sturdy. The design on the Tab S6 is as good as it can get for a modern tablet. I do wish they had an IP rating, but that's something the iPad Pro also lacks. The S-Pen sticks to the back of the tablet. At first, I thought this was weird, especially if you are going to lay down your tablet flat. However, pretty much any case which would flatten the bump and makes it look like the S-Pen is in a tiny hidden pocket. I think some even might prefer this over the iPad Pro approach (which adds extra width).

# Battery

The battery lasts all day of continuous usage. Standby time has been pretty good for me as well, even after leaving it on standby for some days. Overall, I have no complaints in this department.

# Performance

This is one of the smoothest/fastest devices I've used, even after 8 months. The old days of Samsung's laggy software are long gone. The Tab S6 handles everything you throw at it with a breeze. Games, multi-tasking, and just general usage are lag-free and fast. It comes with the latest UFS 3.0 storage which is an upgrade over the UFS 2.1 on the S10. One UI 2 update even brought some nice animations changes. 

# Software

You would think Samsung would slap on their One UI that's on their phones and be done with it, but Samsung did add small but noticeable tablet-specific optimizations and features here and there. The S-Pen and Samsung Dex integration are well done. You can use Samsung Dex straight from your tablet without having to use a second monitor, which is pretty cool. I also really like the new gesture system on One UI 2.1. I no longer have to reach all the way to the bottom just to go back. Overall, I like the software. The system layouts are pretty intuitive and optimized for a tablet. Speaking of layouts...

# App scaling

I've been pretty surprised by how well Android apps work on devices with varying screen sizes. I can't think of any app where I thought the layout was bothering me. I guess if Android apps work well on ChromeOS, foldables, and Samsung Dex, they should work fine on a tablet.

Some Google apps like YouTube, many Samsung apps like Samsung Internet and My Files have some tablet optimizations. By tablet optimizations, I mean letting you see a bit more content at once. I think they are a nice touch, but I don't think they are an absolute necessity on Android since Android already handles app scaling pretty well.

Apps without tablet optimizations work way better than they do on an iPad. Instagram, for example, has massive letterboxing on an iPad. [Whereas on an Android, it's full screen.](https://mobile.twitter.com/daniel_scuteri/status/1265102390782382080) Some might argue Android is just ""enlarging"" the app, but I would say most people would prefer that over a miniature version of the app. Plus, most Android apps make use of the larger screen real estate by displaying more content (for example, more songs on Spotify and more emails at once on Tab S6 vs. S20).

# S-Pen

These are just bigger versions of the S-Pen on the Note series, which are pretty good. Compared to the iPad Pro, the latency could be better, but that's more of a display refresh rate issue.

The biggest problem is the lack of apps that make use of the pen. Some apps like Dropbox Paper have excellent iPad pencil support but no Android pen support. I've found Samsung Notes to be the best at note-taking when it comes to the S-Pen support. Hopefully, more widespread adoption of the Galaxy Note/Fold 2 series will help drive more S-Pen support in apps.

# Main gripes

* Slow updates. I got the Android 10 One UI 2 update a month ago, May 2020. That's pretty late to the party. Some parts of the world got it months earlier but the US got it last. The One UI 2 on S10 was released late Nov 2019, which makes you wonder why it took so long. Security updates are also slow. I get security updates every three months, but my S10 gets them monthly? I am not sure why there's a vast discrepancy in update speed between Samsung's devices. Likely the issue is a mix of long QA testing, limited resources, and carriers taking their time.
* Fingerprint scanner. In the past, the FP scanner had 60% success rate. Nowadays, on the newer version of the software, I think it's pretty good at a \~85% success rate. Still could be better, but these optical fp scanners are surprisingly more accurate to wet, sweaty fingers than the old capacitive fp scanners.
* Camera. It's acceptable. It's a single 12MP camera that is not as good as the S10's camera. I've tried GCAM ports on it, and they do seem to improve picture quality. Tablets have always had weaker cameras than phones, and this is not an exception.
* Poor thermal management when charging. If I'm playing a graphically intensive game while charging, the frame-rate drops 10 minutes in. My S10 does not do this, even though they have the same SoC, and the tablet has a larger surface area for heat dissipation. I guess that the Tab S6 lacks the liquid cooling of the S10 and/or the system doesn't correctly slow its charging speed under load.

# Final thoughts

The Tab S6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. Every time I use this device, I can't help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. A lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. The Tab S6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best Android tablet, or the best 10"" entertainment device, I think this tablet should be #1 on your list.

&lt;p&gt;The Tab S6 is a surprisingly good premium android tablet that does many things right. Every time I use this device, I can&amp;#39;t help but think it deserves a lot more recognition than it gets. A lot of popular tech reviewers seem to overlook this tablet entirely. The Tab S6 is without a doubt an expensive tablet, but if you are someone who is strictly looking for the best Android tablet, or the best 10&amp;quot; entertainment device, I think this tablet should be #1 on your list.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"Hi all. I'm sorry if you already knew this, but I would love to inform some android users about practices by Xiaomi and probably many others.

So I bought this new Xiaomi Note 8 Pro about 1 month ago. I've been hesitant to swap my sim-card to this new phone, since I kinda wanted to keep it ""clean"", and remove all bloatware before I use it. I didn't want it to get linked to me personally, so I also created a new google account etc.

Now I know what you're thinking... it doesn't change a thing. And you're right, it doesn't. 
But I'm not here to talk about googles practices (which are equally shady..) but about Xiaomi's.

The problem is that there are default installed apps that cannot be removed that are linked to Xiaomi. I tracked the wifi-traffic and noticed that over a dozen apps or services try to communicate my data to servers of Xiaomi, Amazon, Facebook and Alibaba. (and more). There was no facebook installed, no amazon app, this was a clean phone. 

So I went to my computer and via USB disabled a bunch of default apps that were obviously there to track... Default contacts, messages, Gmail, even the Gallery app is there to send your shit to xiaomi and others.. .
The calculator requires access to your phonecalls,sdcard,.. , your calendar wants wifi, messages,... It's all just rigged.

Now I've been obsessing over these issues lately, and I dug a little deeper. What I just found out, and it may not come as a shock, is that EVERYTHING YOU DO on this phone, even with wifi turned off, is stored in log-files, ready to be sent to the ""mi cloudservice"". By almost 20 Different services that are running on your phone, and you can't disable it. There's this security app that has access to every part of your phone, and it can reset your ""custom"" settings for certain apps. So if you disable access to contacts for your calculator... ""security app"" by xiaomi has the rights to just undo your changes.

It's horrible...

I spent a lot (subjective..) on a pretty ass phone, but I feel sick using it and just transmitting my data every time it connects to the wifi. It tracks the SIM Card I put in it, logs that my ""SIM_STATUS_CHANGED"", with a personalized ID, so they can just start tracking with that ID. I'm sorry for the rant, but I feel like new potential clients should know this stuff before they buy it.

There is no way out. If you disable too many services, your phone starts to work against you. I get popups from ""Google play service"" that says I have to enable all their access requests, or my mobile game won't work"". spoiler.. the game just works. it's just that they know you disabled them in a certain way, and want you to think you NEED to allow them access. 


Again... Sorry for the rant, but I'm utterly disgusted. I live in west-europe and I'm being apparantly tracked by 5 huge companies by just owning a stupid ass phone, and I can't turn that shit off.


There will be people saying ""what do you have to hide"", but they just don't know that invading privacy is just a huge step in the wrong direction for all of humanity.

For those who have nothing to hide I suggest checking this video and maybe more from his channel. ""The hated one"" ; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hjspu7QV7O0

I bought this new Xiaomi phone, (MIUI) and found out some horrible practices that many android-users should be made aware of.",[],r/Android,False,6,removed,0,,,False,t3_e54ps1,False,dark,0.8,,public,1185,0,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Misleading Title,False,1185,,False,self,1575474485.0,,[],{},self,,True,,1575346349.0,text,6,,,text,self.Android,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all. I&amp;#39;m sorry if you already knew this, but I would love to inform some android users about practices by Xiaomi and probably many others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I bought this new Xiaomi Note 8 Pro about 1 month ago. I&amp;#39;ve been hesitant to swap my sim-card to this new phone, since I kinda wanted to keep it &amp;quot;clean&amp;quot;, and remove all bloatware before I use it. I didn&amp;#39;t want it to get linked to me personally, so I also created a new google account etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I know what you&amp;#39;re thinking... it doesn&amp;#39;t change a thing. And you&amp;#39;re right, it doesn&amp;#39;t. 
But I&amp;#39;m not here to talk about googles practices (which are equally shady..) but about Xiaomi&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there are default installed apps that cannot be removed that are linked to Xiaomi. I tracked the wifi-traffic and noticed that over a dozen apps or services try to communicate my data to servers of Xiaomi, Amazon, Facebook and Alibaba. (and more). There was no facebook installed, no amazon app, this was a clean phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I went to my computer and via USB disabled a bunch of default apps that were obviously there to track... Default contacts, messages, Gmail, even the Gallery app is there to send your shit to xiaomi and others.. .
The calculator requires access to your phonecalls,sdcard,.. , your calendar wants wifi, messages,... It&amp;#39;s all just rigged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#39;ve been obsessing over these issues lately, and I dug a little deeper. What I just found out, and it may not come as a shock, is that EVERYTHING YOU DO on this phone, even with wifi turned off, is stored in log-files, ready to be sent to the &amp;quot;mi cloudservice&amp;quot;. By almost 20 Different services that are running on your phone, and you can&amp;#39;t disable it. There&amp;#39;s this security app that has access to every part of your phone, and it can reset your &amp;quot;custom&amp;quot; settings for certain apps. So if you disable access to contacts for your calculator... &amp;quot;security app&amp;quot; by xiaomi has the rights to just undo your changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s horrible...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spent a lot (subjective..) on a pretty ass phone, but I feel sick using it and just transmitting my data every time it connects to the wifi. It tracks the SIM Card I put in it, logs that my &amp;quot;SIM_STATUS_CHANGED&amp;quot;, with a personalized ID, so they can just start tracking with that ID. I&amp;#39;m sorry for the rant, but I feel like new potential clients should know this stuff before they buy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no way out. If you disable too many services, your phone starts to work against you. I get popups from &amp;quot;Google play service&amp;quot; that says I have to enable all their access requests, or my mobile game won&amp;#39;t work&amp;quot;. spoiler.. the game just works. it&amp;#39;s just that they know you disabled them in a certain way, and want you to think you NEED to allow them access. &lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"Hi everyone,

over the last \~500 days, I used a script on my OnePlus 6T, which documented information like the current security patch of my phone, and the time that has passed since the last OTA update.

I did this in order to check how well OnePlus is doing with (security) updates, especially with regard to their ""OnePlus Software Maintenance Schedule"" ([https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-software-maintenance-schedule.862347/)). And now that I have all the data, I thought I might as well share it with you.

At first, I made a plot, which shows the age of the security patch over time (starting from April 9th, 2019, half a year after launch): https://imgur.com/hBNTqtx.

* On those days that have a green star, the security patch was very recent (&lt;= 30 days, which is the ways it should be).
* Orange points have a patch that is between 31 and 60 days old,
* the red points are between 61 and 90 days,
* and for the purple points, the security patch is older than 90 days!

**On average, the security patch on the OnePlus 6T was 58 days old**. For comparison, a phone that always gets the latest patch at the beginning of each month (i.e. a Pixel phone), would have an average of \~15 days, and a phone that gets patched at the beginning of each second month would have an average of \~30 days.

I also took a look at the time between new versions of OxygenOS and found that **on average OnePlus updated the OnePlus 6T every** **~~35~~** **41 days. The fastest update was after 18 days and the longest update took 73 days.** (I could also make a plot if you want, but I think that this is less interesting).

Thus, in summary we can say that while OnePlus kept their promise to deliver bimonthly updates, these updates did not always include the most recent security patch.

Finally, it took OnePlus **25 days to upgrade the 6T from Android 9 to Android 10** and the **Linux kernel on the 6T was upgraded only once in all of this time.** Currently, the kernel is 54 revisions behind.

I hope that this data is interesting for some of you.

PS: I also managed to run my script on a Nokia phone with Android One. Once I have enough data for this phone, I might update this post. In general, it would also be nice to compare this data with the one from other manufactures.

\[EDIT\] The 6T launched at the beginning of November 2018, but I only I started logging the data on April 9th, 2019, i.e. half a year after the release of the phone.

\[EDIT\] Here is the code, in case you want to run the macro/script on your own device: [https://github.com/skumblex/android-patch-logger](https://github.com/skumblex/android-patch-logger). I hope that the device properties that I used are available on all device. If this is not the case, please let me know.

,Android,"Bringing this back because the last post I saw on this topic was in 2017, which I think could be considered a little outdated. 

I switched to Android around the start of the year and I've been loving it; the customization, the features, the fact that it's not made by Apple, etc. One problem though: I can't find a Reddit app that suits me. I'm sure you know of the various stability and user experience issues that come with the official Reddit app, so I prefer to use alternatives.
 On IOS, I used Apollo for its simple, intuitive, and user-friendly design. It felt primarily focused on casual browsing and posting, and that suited me. But Apollo isn't on Android, so I ended up using Sync instead, after reading approximately one article on it.

Sync is... fine, it works, but it doesn't quite work for me. I'm not saying its bad, it just doesn't suit how I use Reddit. So I'd like you to share what version of Reddit you prefer and why.

It has a built-in updater (if apk is downloaded from github) so you aren't reliant on app-store services and you don't need to have play store account, like a lot of elderly don't. Themes: Light, Dark, Adaptive, where adaptive turns on the dark mode at the evening and switches to light theme in the morning.

I'm not the author, i just really like this program, so i found as much about it as i could, and i started contributing to it because i've been trying other ""free"" and paid solutions before for my parents and it didn't really work out. Then i saw Baldphone on some subreddit post, it is Open-source, i like that it has built-in updater, simple gallery, i hope it gets good community support and development.

**PS**. If i find more useful info on it, i will add it to the post.

Two weeks ago I was delighted to find that my Google app has finally joined the dark mode club. The joy didn't last long though: After two days dark mode was gone again, so I went ahead and installed the latest beta. First it was still glaring white, but after a day or so I was back on the dark side. This lasted for about one and a half weeks. Today I woke up with a glaring white Google app again.

Seriously Google, how is that considered good user experience?

The same happened with Play Store, I had dark more for like 2 days only for it to vanish again.

I get the concept of A/B testing, but what Google is doing is excessive. A/B testing should be giving one group of users a feature, test it, roll it out to the next group, etc. and not ""give group A feature X, take it away, reintroduce it, take it away again and bring it back again"".

,Android,"There was a recent thread calling out Samsung for pushing ads via notification - https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/hdaf59/samsung_pushing_ads_in_notifications_even_though/  

But nobody seems to be calling out OnePlus for turning their OS into a advertisement machine. Everytime I enter settings I have a huge unremovable card with a red dot blaring at me. 

I don't give a shit about their red cable nonsense and I didn't pay for a phone to be infested with ads in its settings app.  
  

Here's a screenshot for reference -

EDIT 1 - For everyone telling me it's merely a login service. IT'S NOT. It's an ad infested bloatware that is being masked as an account login service. Once you login, the cards start displaying red dots indicating a new notification. It's an entire advertisement centre once you tap on the card. I should have posted a second picture for clarity.

After OnePlus 8 was launched, they heavily advertised the phones, bullets etc. In this advertisement centre.

EDIT 2 - OnePlus was also planning to preinstall Netflix and Facebook on future phones/OS updates but dropped the idea after lashback from community

,Android,"hi i don't really know how to structure this but i had this on my mind for a very long time here we go:

1: (the reviews are shallow) i just finished watching mkbhd's video on the s20 ultra(just using him as an example these things apply to most other popular creators). i found his review extremely shallow even though the review is almost 20 minutes.(almost all his reviews are like this)  he only went through points which most people knew about, the first 5 minutes was just fluff and d brand sponsorship 

2: (the lack of criticism) the s20 ultra cost $1,400, instead of challenging why this phone cost so much, all mkbhd says this has all the specs, but that doesn't justify such a huge price increase, samsung is charging so much yet the phone will only get 2 year software support, this phone such a bad value for money yet  that does not factor into the review 

they don't purchase the phone with there own money, which can completely change the way you  view a product( i don't expect them to start buying phones, but i do expect these biases to be taken in consideration when doing reviews

all the tech youtubers are afraid to criticise tech companies because if they do they wont receive review units in the future(they will throw a little jab here and there that's it)

3:(style over substance) the production quality is so so high yet the actual review is dogshit, mkbhd has being saying for years how he is going to improves his reviews, the only thing that improved is the gear he uses over the years, the actual reviews have stayed the same 

4: this guy just proves that youtubers don't know what they are taling about  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtd7UzLJHrU&amp;t=218s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rtd7UzLJHrU&amp;t=218s) 

tldr: youtubers are just glorified marketers for the companies

Edit: some people seem to think youtubers cant be criticised just because ""we are not the target audience"" what you people dont realise is that these reviewes affect us all.


These tech reviewers have a big impact on the industry.

,Android,"I'm someone who has used many flagship Android phones in the past 6 years - namely LG G4, S6 Edge+, S7 Edge, S9 and S10+. I'm an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I'm not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I've used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bg2bb2/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bo2ohn/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10/).

I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.

My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4"" S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the ""smaller"" Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the ""smaller"" iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).

**Performance &amp; Software Experience**

The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won't know the feeling that I'm talking about.

For sure, I miss the S10+'s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It's really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone's software is usually supported for \~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I'm wrong).

**Processor Disparity**

The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What's even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won't be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US/Hong Kong/South Korea/Canada?). It's like you're using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying. 

This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won't have to think about importing.

**RAM Management**

Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don't need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it's not a huge deal since the iPhone's performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.

**Display**

The S10+ has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn't bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn't overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+'s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in *Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration* and *Camera*), so I'm not too annoyed at that. 

For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro's cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I'm someone who can always tell the difference between FHD/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.

Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6/S7/S9/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than ""One Hand Operations"" and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can't put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro's slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.

**Camera**

Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR'd. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn't soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I'd still be fine with it today. 

Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+'s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone's.

**Physical Build**

This is all preference here, and I think they're both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.

**Inputs and Storage**

The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn't enough for me. A ""pro"" phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.

**Battery**

The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I'm regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I'll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro's battery holds up.

Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.

**Speakers**

Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It's just slightly louder I think.

**Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness**

For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have [annoying and intrusive ads](https://i.imgur.com/DTqN7Uqr.jpg) on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don't want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don't want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don't want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it's not a huge deal.

For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn't mean all apps are ""bad"" on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.

The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don't use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like ""Samsung Browser"", ""Samsung Health"" and ""Sound Assistant"" from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you'll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like ""PaymentFramework UI"" update from Galaxy Store, or ""Billing"" or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung/Android just feels a bit weird.

**File Management**

S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can't do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I'd prefer not to. 

**Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button**

I personally don't like to use my voice too much, but here's my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn't a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.

For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into ""car mode"" when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can't just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.

The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn't perfect.

The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don't like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn't have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.

**Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration**

The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn't that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it's just a camera image based scanner so it isn't secure at all, doesn't work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.  

The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn't turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn't have an issue with!  The iPhone's proximity sensor works fine.

Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a ""loose vibration"" where as the iPhone vibration feels more ""compact and precise"" - hard to describe.

Overall, the biometrics, sensors and ""little things"" are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.

**Contactless Payment**

Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+  the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn't available. So when someone gives you the ""we don't have pay-wave"", you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I've only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.

Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn't bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).

The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it's located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn't a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.

**Price ($AUD) and Value**

Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn't be that much more expensive than an S10+.

However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.

**Verdict**

Taking all these factors into account, right now I'd personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.

Since I obviously like writing about tech, I started my own [blog](https://tech22space.blogspot.com/) if you are interested.",t2_e0qrtja,False,,1,False,Moving from S10+ to iPhone 11 Pro - An In-Depth Review and Comparison,[],r/Android,False,6,,0,,,False,t3_g8sssq,False,dark,0.86,,public,963,2,{},,e758c8e6-fda3-11e0-8674-12313b0cf4c9,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,963,,False,self,1588000062.0,userGray,[],"{'gid_2': 1, 'gid_3': 1}",self,,True,,1587987090.0,text,6,,,text,self.Android,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m someone who has used many flagship Android phones in the past 6 years - namely LG G4, S6 Edge+, S7 Edge, S9 and S10+. I&amp;#39;m an engineer, and very much a technical guy and so I always enjoyed Android. Before my LG G4, I used the iPhone 3G, iPhone 4, iPhone 5S, so I&amp;#39;m not foreign to the Apple world too. I had the S10+ (Exynos) from release date, for a little over a year. This is a review of how I feel about the S10+ (a recent flagship Samsung) and the iPhone 11 Pro (a recent flagship iPhone) which I&amp;#39;ve used for over a month now. For S10 and other Samsung users, I made these threads of tips &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bg2bb2/mega_pro_tips_make_the_most_of_your_s10_settings/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/comments/bo2ohn/mega_pro_tips_part_2_make_the_most_of_your_s10/""&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say that even though my in-depth review is written for the S10+ specifically, most of it is still relevant for the S20 series, so anyone tossing up between the S20 series and iPhone 11 Pro series will find this useful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My motivation for changing phones: I wanted a smaller phone as my 6.4&amp;quot; S10+ felt too big for my small hands. I always research phones, and battery is a huge factor to me, so I know that the &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; Android flagships always have really subpar battery - i.e. S10E, Pixel 3, Pixel 4, etc. I found that the &amp;quot;smaller&amp;quot; iPhone 11 Pro is still a champ in the battery department. I also wanted to try the newest iPhone of 2019 as my last one was from 2013 (the 5S).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Performance &amp;amp; Software Experience&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 11 Pro simply wins here, by far. Everything is absolutely seamless and free-flowing, and there is never even a slight hiccup. The whole OS is incredibly stable and smooth. The S10+ made leaps and bounds with One UI and Android 9 and 10, for sure. However, I feel that any flagship Android just has that ever so slight hiccup in experience compared to the same-generation iPhone, and this is only explainable if you have used a latest generation iPhone for a few days. If you have not, you probably won&amp;#39;t know the feeling that I&amp;#39;m talking about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For sure, I miss the S10+&amp;#39;s software customization with things like One Hand Operations+, Good Lock, Launchers and so on. However, what the iPhone lacks in customization, it more than makes up for in feel and experience. Every single thing that I do on my phone is a pleasure to do due to this amazing software feel. For example, the landscape rotation on the S10+ is always a bit glitchy and laggy, for games and other landscape apps, where as the iPhone transitions so smoothly between portrait and landscape apps, and going home from them, etc. It&amp;#39;s really a matter of taste, but my opinion is that the extreme smoothness and seamless experience/integration trumps the ability of full customization with widgets and launchers, etc. Also, the iPhone&amp;#39;s software is usually supported for ~ 5 generational updates, where as for the S10+, it is 2 generations of updates (and then only security patches like the S7 got for some years). This is really disappointing for the S10+ and all other Android flagships (except the Pixel? Correct me if I&amp;#39;m wrong).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Processor Disparity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disparity between the Exynos and Snapdragon models for Samsung flagships is very, very disappointing. Firstly, the battery performance of the Exynos models are simply worse in every way, especially standby drain. Secondly, it heats up more and thermal throttling is worse. Lastly, even the camera processing is different however neither wins here, but perhaps the Snapdragon takes better photos. What&amp;#39;s even more annoying is, you could be reading reviews online before buying the S10+ but those reviews will be Snapdragon-American reviews so their battery and performance reviews won&amp;#39;t be the same as the Exynos version of the phone in your region (everywhere in the world but US/Hong Kong/South Korea/Canada?). It&amp;#39;s like you&amp;#39;re using a totally different phone almost. Before the S8, the Exynos was superior and the Snapdragon was worse. This disparity really has to stop, Samsung. Due to this big difference, some people even import Samsung phones from Snapdragon-countries to get a better phone, but lose out on the home-country warranties, repairs and support. This is just so annoying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is totally different for the iPhone side, because I can be 100% sure that every review I read on the iPhone 11 Pro will be the exact same phone that I will buy in my country. No headache at all, won&amp;#39;t have to think about importing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RAM Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both phones are great in this - remember folks, you don&amp;#39;t need to close your apps on phones these days unless they are bugging! I did notice though that the S10+ with its 8GB RAM kept more apps open in the background than the iPhone. But it&amp;#39;s not a huge deal since the iPhone&amp;#39;s performance is faster anyway and opening apps from the beginning is super fast anyway. But the S10+ wins here for keeping more apps open in the background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S10+ has a gorgeous WQHD+ display (1440x3040) and I loved it, watching YouTube and Netflix was a pleasure, and the hole cut didn&amp;#39;t bother me after just a week of getting used to it. The iPhone 11 Pro still has a really high-quality display (1125x2436) and I found the colour balance to be much nicer than the S10+, i.e. the colour gamut was more pleasurable to look at and wasn&amp;#39;t overly vivid. The HDR and contrast of both screens are excellent. The iPhone has a big notch and that takes a bit of getting used to - however the sensors and camera there do an excellent job compared to the S10+&amp;#39;s respective sensors and camera (referenced later in the review in &lt;em&gt;Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Camera&lt;/em&gt;), so I&amp;#39;m not too annoyed at that. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For all apps and activities, both screens are excellent. Only on YouTube and Netflix, I give the edge to the S10+ because it has 1440p instead of the iPhone 11 Pro&amp;#39;s cap at 1080p - and I can definitely notice it. I&amp;#39;m someone who can always tell the difference between FHD/QHD. Also the S10+ has Always-on-Display which shows the time, date and notification icons which I really liked - however it drained a little battery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, I was a partial fan of the edge display of the Samsung phones (which I had on the S6/S7/S9/S10 series) and it is cool. However, other than &amp;quot;One Hand Operations&amp;quot; and the odd use of the edge panel, I had no need for it and the drawbacks are bad. You can&amp;#39;t put a good screen protector on the curved screens and they often interfere with cases, hence I rocked my S10+ with the factory protector and when that was worn out, I rocked it naked. Also, the edge display has more accidental touches unless you have a thicker case on. The iPhone 11 Pro&amp;#39;s slight increase in side bezel was so good for me - it meant that I could never make an accidental touch and I had a flat screen for once! I was able to flawlessly install a Spigen glass protector onto it - wonderful! This was such a big relief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Camera&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both cameras are fantastic off the bat. On the S10+, I found that I had to turn Scene Optimizer off to get nice natural-ish shots, otherwise they would be way too saturated and HDR&amp;#39;d. Night Mode goes to the iPhone, hands down - the exposure toggle on this phone is excellent. The S10+ has made improvements in Night photography but it is still behind. The Ultra Wide Angle camera on the S10+ picks up slightly more detail but always has an unwanted extra saturation and HDR added to it that makes it look unpleasant (even without Scene Optimizer). The portrait mode on the iPhone is more versatile and has cooler options like the contrast black/white portraits. Both phones do a great job taking portrait shots overall. I give the camera win to the iPhone for sure, any random shot is usually always better on the iPhone. There is more detail in the pictures, and colours are way more natural - also gives me more room to edit photos in Lightroom/Snapseed. Front camera is much better on the iPhone as it retains detail and doesn&amp;#39;t soften the face too much like the S10+ does. But to be honest, once I modified the camera settings on my S10+ to my liking, it was an excellent camera system overall and I&amp;#39;d still be fine with it today. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the Camera app on the iPhone is just far, far superior. There is no delays in switching between modes and sub-modes, and video recording is also flawless. The S10+&amp;#39;s Camera app is fine, but simply not as seamless and smooth as the iPhone&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical Build&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is all preference here, and I think they&amp;#39;re both awesome. I like that the S10+ weighs less than the regular iPhone 11 Pro (175g vs. 188g) - note that this is for the glass-back S10+, the ceramic-back S10+ weighs 198g. Also I like that all 3 cameras on the S10+ lie on one flat plane, where as the iPhone 11 Pro has 3 separate circles - this is just nit picking, but three separate camera circles indented means a bit more dust particles gathering there. Both phones are beautiful and solid overall, but the S10+ gets the slight win here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inputs and Storage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S10+ gets the win for inputs simply because it has a headphone jack and micro SD card slot - I always used the SD card slot with a 64GB card to turn my 128GB phone into 192GB. I used the Galaxy Buds so I hardly ever needed the headphone jack, but it was still useful to have. On the iPhone, I was forced to buy the 256GB model because the lowest storage model at 64GB isn&amp;#39;t enough for me. A &amp;quot;pro&amp;quot; phone should start at 128GB minimum. Another difference is that the iPhone 11 Pro can support a second SIM via an eSIM. The S10+ has both single SIM and dual SIM models - usually most countries sell the single SIM version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone 11 Pro (non max) is better than the S10+ (the max equivalent) in battery - this is pretty incredible although mind you, I had the Exynos model. Firstly, standby battery drain is amazing on the iPhone, better than the Samsung. The S10+ had pretty good battery to be honest, but on the iPhone I&amp;#39;m regularly getting 8 hours of Screen-on-Time a month in. The S10+ got around 6-7 hours out of the box, but then degraded over time. I had the Exynos S10+ which suffers in 4G idle drain as well, which is a pity. Shame on Samsung for such a huge disparity between the two processors. I guess I&amp;#39;ll have to wait a year to see how the iPhone 11 Pro&amp;#39;s battery holds up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Secondly, for the S10+ (and many other Androids), a user has to tinker with so many different settings and annoying little toggles and everything to squeeze a good battery life out of it. For example on the S10+, you have to tinker with adaptive battery, adaptive power save, deep sleeping apps, normal sleeping apps, optimized charging, turning things off like Nearby Device Scanning, etc. The list goes on but you always have to play around with the settings a lot to get good battery out of it. On the iPhone, there are some things you may want to turn off but overall if you leave the phone as it is out of the box, it will still give great battery performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speakers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both are excellent with their stereo speakers, I might give the slightest edge to the S10+ here. It&amp;#39;s just slightly louder I think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apps, Update Structure and Cleanness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For stock apps - both phones have good stock apps for Clock, Calendar, Calculator, etc. However for the S10+, stock apps like Samsung Weather, Samsung Pay, Samsung Health, etc. always have &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/DTqN7Uqr.jpg""&gt;annoying and intrusive ads&lt;/a&gt; on the top banner. When I go into Samsung Health, I don&amp;#39;t want to see ads for Galaxy Watch or the Calm Meditation app. When I go into weather, I don&amp;#39;t want to see random ads and when I go to Samsung Pay I don&amp;#39;t want to see ads for YouTube Premium or a Note 10. I have checked all possible settings and you cannot opt out of these ads, and it varies by region. This is unacceptable for the stock apps on a phone, especially such an expensive one. The iPhone counterparts for these apps are always much cleaner and with zero ads of course. The photos app on the iPhone is smoother and faster than the gallery app on the S10+, but it&amp;#39;s not a huge deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For third party apps, in every instance, the iOS app is better in experience. Spotify is so much smoother and nicer, so is Instagram, Snapchat, Facebook, Reddit, and so on. Almost all apps seem to be made better on iOS in my experience so far. But that doesn&amp;#39;t mean all apps are &amp;quot;bad&amp;quot; on Android, they are generally pretty good and I only appreciated the difference when I got the iPhone 11 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S10+ has an annoying app structure and update integration. Firstly, you have duplicate apps and bloat apps out of the box with a mix of Google and Samsung apps for things like Email, Browser, etc. and other carrier software (if you got it from a carrier) so you have to disable the ones you don&amp;#39;t use. Secondly, there is a Galaxy Store as well as the usual Play Store to complicate things. The one good thing I got from the Galaxy Store is Good Lock (for added customization). Otherwise, I find it really weird that you can get things like &amp;quot;Samsung Browser&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Samsung Health&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Sound Assistant&amp;quot; from both Galaxy Store and Play Store - it just complicates things. Also for the Samsung, you&amp;#39;ll get miscellaneous system updates from Play Store and Galaxy Store, and often they are really confusing like &amp;quot;PaymentFramework UI&amp;quot; update from Galaxy Store, or &amp;quot;Billing&amp;quot; or any other little update within the software of the phone. Things like this are just confusing for the user and should just be done in major OS updates or in silence, it makes the experience feel cluttered. On the iPhone 11 Pro, the App Store is the only place to get apps and it updates in silence (no notifications like Android). And all system related updates are done in iOS updates. For a technical guy like me, these factors are fine but for the average user, it really makes the iPhone stand out in this regard where as the Samsung/Android just feels a bit weird.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;File Management&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;S10+ wins here, all day. You can connect to a PC to drag and drop any folder of photos, videos, music, files, and it just works in all apps flawlessly. You can&amp;#39;t do that with the iPhone and you have to sync photo folders through iTunes or iCloud. When you connect your iPhone to a PC, all you can do is browser through the DCIM folder of photos and videos, and you cannot write anything to the disk space either. Where as on my Samsung, I can put in any file like a computer - PDFs, docs, songs, photos, whatever. It just works so well. For the iPhone, I need to heavily use iCloud Drive or Dropbox for these things which I&amp;#39;d prefer not to. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Voice Assistant, Automations, Dedicated Button&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally don&amp;#39;t like to use my voice too much, but here&amp;#39;s my review of both systems. Firstly, Bixby is not very good on the S10+ - the software is cluttered and the voice control isn&amp;#39;t a seamless, nice experience. However, it can do some quite in-depth things if you can learn how to do it, such as opening apps and doing very specific things in them, or changing in-depth settings. Siri on the iPhone is decent and can help out with quite a few things, but again it also has its limitations. I think it is more seamless and smooth than Bixby, but its capabilities are similar. The S10+ also has Google Assistant integrated into the system which is probably the best voice assistant in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For automation, I found Bixby Routines to be excellent. I was able to create routines for putting my phone into &amp;quot;car mode&amp;quot; when connecting to its Bluetooth - it would automatically open Spotify and play my library, and this worked every single time. I also created many other routines such as when reaching my work location, go to silent and media volume to 0%. Great experience. For the iPhone, the Automations functionality is workable but there are disadvantages. Bluetooth cannot be activated instantly without a user input prompt and unlock, for security reasons. So I can&amp;#39;t just walk into my car and let the music auto-play - it will only auto-play if Spotify was open. If Spotify is closed, I have to go into my phone and do it myself. I give the automation win to Samsung for sure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The iPhone also has shortcuts (custom commands) which can go into great detail - much more than the Samsung, and you can download a bunch of unique shortcuts created by others for things like Media downloading. This is quite cool but it isn&amp;#39;t perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The S10+ has a dedicated Bixby button. Out of the box, this is useless if it connects to Bixby which most people don&amp;#39;t like to use. However, you can use the BxActions app to re-route the button to anything you like. I set it up so that if I hold the Bixby button down it would turn on the flashlight (a literal lifesaver!) and if I press it, it flicks between Sound, Vibrate and Silent. This was awesome. The iPhone doesn&amp;#39;t have a dedicated hardware button for doing whatever I like with it. However it does have a physical switch for Sound and Silent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biometrics, Sensors, Vibration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The in-display fingerprint scanner worked quite well for me usually (a lot of others had issues with this). However, it just wasn&amp;#39;t that smooth of an experience, there would always be a slight hiccup when waking the phone with fingerprint. Face recognition on the S10+ is not good - firstly, it&amp;#39;s just a camera image based scanner so it isn&amp;#39;t secure at all, doesn&amp;#39;t work too well in the dark (hence the screen has to brighten itself) and I found the circle ring animation on the lock screen to be bad in design. Face ID on the iPhone seems to work from much wider angles and work in basically every scenario ever, and it is super seamless. Also the notification contents are hidden until it is unlocked with a successful face scan, and I love that. The S10+ has a little advantage though, because you can just scan your finger while the phone is flat on a table and open it, where as for the iPhone, I have to move my face to look at it. The iPhone has a little advantage too - it has single-tap to wake which I prefer, where as the S10+ only has double-tap to wake. Slight difference, but not a big deal.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proximity sensor (such a simple given thing on any smartphone) was simply not good on the S10+. There was a proximity sensor issue and battery drain in the early months, and after Viber/WhatsApp calls, the proximity sensor would cause issues and drain battery. Also, the Always On Display wouldn&amp;#39;t turn off when in a pocket, which the S7 Edge and S9 didn&amp;#39;t have an issue with!  The iPhone&amp;#39;s proximity sensor works fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haptic feedback (vibrations) on the iPhone 11 Pro is simply leagues ahead. There is a great level of precision between the levels of vibration and it feels great, plus many of the system and app elements use varying degrees of haptic feedback to the user and I really like it. Actually I never had an issue with the S10+ haptic feedback, but once I used the iPhone, then I realised that it can be done even better. In comparison, the S10+ just feels like a &amp;quot;loose vibration&amp;quot; where as the iPhone vibration feels more &amp;quot;compact and precise&amp;quot; - hard to describe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the biometrics, sensors and &amp;quot;little things&amp;quot; are simply better on the iPhone, hands down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Contactless Payment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hardware capability wise, Samsung Pay wins since it has MST (Magnetic Secure Transmission) which gives the S10+  the ability to emulate the swipe of a physical card when NFC-based payment isn&amp;#39;t available. So when someone gives you the &amp;quot;we don&amp;#39;t have pay-wave&amp;quot;, you can still wow them and pay with your S10+. However, I&amp;#39;ve only found this useful when travelling, as in Australia, I found that every single payment terminal always has contactless payments, even in random country towns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software wise for payments, the iPhone 11 Pro wins without question. The Apple Pay (or Wallet) app is much, much cleaner than Samsung Pay. The process of making a payment from the moment your phone is in your pocket is significantly faster on the iPhone - you double tap the lock button and instantly it uses Face ID then has your primary card ready to make a payment, literally takes 1 second. For Samsung Pay, you can swipe up from the bottom while the screen is off and then there is always a slight delay before Samsung Pay opens, then you have to use the in-display fingerprint scanner and finally you are able to pay - this takes much more time than Apple Pay. It didn&amp;#39;t bother me too much until I used Apple Pay and I was in awe of how fast this process is on the iPhone. Also, as discussed above, the Samsung Pay app has ads on the top banner which is unacceptable. This could not be removed no matter how many settings I tried (others in different regions have been able to remove them).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The location of the NFC chip on the S10+ is towards the middle of the back of the phone so you have to place the back onto a scanner, kind of. On the iPhone, it&amp;#39;s located on the top border of the phone so you kind of just hold it out like a beam. This isn&amp;#39;t a huge deal but I find that slightly more convenient. For me, Apple Pay wins overall since my country has no need for MST, and the software experience is way better. But others may find Samsung Pay better because of this unique feature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price ($AUD) and Value&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Release day RRP for the S10+ 128GB was $1499 and for my iPhone 11 Pro 256GB was $1999 (64GB model was $1749). I think that overall, the iPhone is severely overpriced, and the S10+ is also quite overpriced but it is easier to find promotions and deals on the S10+. Flagships overall have spiraled into ridiculous prices, but I think the iPhone 11 Pro shouldn&amp;#39;t be that much more expensive than an S10+.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, the iPhone wins hands down in retaining value over time. After 1 or 2 years, the iPhone will always re-sell for more because they garner more interest than used Android phones, and secondly, they are usually in good nick comparatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verdict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all these factors into account, right now I&amp;#39;d personally go with the iPhone 11 Pro. However, the S10 and S20 series are still fantastic phones and you may prefer them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I obviously like writing about tech, I started my own &lt;a href=""https://tech22space.blogspot.com/""&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; if you are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"Some time ago we [talked how Bluetooth Low Energy 4.x/5.x is not equal in various flagships (Apple included)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ak2tqq/what_is_really_wrong_with_bluetooth_5_how_the/) and also [how with some of the most expensive flagships GPS/GNSS also might be a bigger compromise than you would expect](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/amob8i/last_weekend_we_talked_about_how_not_all_ble_5/).

The issue for this post is Bluetooth Audio and how things on this front are far from great especially in Android. Many people already know something is not right since they always run into issues with skipping sound and bad noise or bad sound in their headphones – but to learn why that takes place and how you can avoid/improve this you will need to read to the end of this AND DO YOUR OWN TESTS YOURSELF (also that type of problems might take place even when you are OK with less than good/excellent audio compression, so it might still be worth reading anyway).

The subject of what is wrong with Bluetooth in general and audio in special is so long that can’t be covered fully in just a few paragraphs, but generally you might be having quality problems or transmission problems – if quality is not that much of an issue just skim over first part below and go to the transmission issues in the 2nd part.

Let’s first define what I am calling here good quality headphone audio – you don’t really need well-over-1000 buckaroos (name which I will use as a reference for USD in US and EUR in Europe) reference studio headphones to get good quality (you can get exceptional quality if money is no object but that is not the topic here), you can in fact get good quality starting slightly below 100 buckaroos with some good WIRED headphones. So you would expect that if you buy a wireless model that is 3-4 times more expensive you will be able to enjoy at all times about the same good audio quality – unfortunately you are definitely wrong about the “at all times” part and that might be in fact close to never by default (unless you really optimize your setup).

One quick observation – if you want to investigate audio quality the only ultra-reliable way is with special measuring device, but you can still get some decent results with your own ears (or somebody else’s “golden ears”) as long as you test properly (if your input sound is some 128 kbps MP3 or some internet streaming service you are doing it wrong, you need FLAC or other lossless sources to test properly). Your best results will come if you test comparatively almost side-by-side (or at least if you can change settings “on the fly” and you focus on how the sound changes). It is also important to know what types of the sound are most sensitive for instance to compression settings – in my experience classical music with a mix of string and brass instruments tends to show much easier differences in compression settings as a result of their much higher harmonics (if I would have to pick a single piece for testing I would pick Beethoven’s 5th in the Gardiner version with a strong accent on the finale). Most of my very recent tests have been done on Sony MDR1000X and Sony WH1000XM3 which also have their own set of quirks – in fact the older MDR1000X which are “mark 1” have a cleaner sound than the newer “mark 3” and both sound MUCH better for absolute sound quality in a quiet room with noise cancelling disabled (and powered-on even on wired tests – impedance it around 47ohm like that vs around 16ohm when non-powered); however 1000XM3 are a huge lot better on noise cancelling so for travel are vastly superior.

I will direct people that are newer to the topic of Bluetooth codecs to an article like this - https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/ - but to simplify things for the rest of this we will have to agree that you can’t have good quality beyond a certain compression level and most people (myself included) would generally consider good to very good only (optimally) compressed streams above 500 kbps, with the streams in the 250-350 kbps being rather in the range of acceptable than good to very good. People might complain that 250-320 kbps is perfectly good for them (that could be mostly the Apple people where AAC only goes as far as 250-320 kbps) and of course (and as you can see in the link provided and many other on the internet) there will be people that will consider the 500 kbps not enough and some will fault even 900+ kbps - but for the moment let’s go forward with this convention/compromise – since you might encounter problems even with that, or even with lower values and bigger compromises – and that has something to do with hardware and especially low-level driver limitations even in the most expensive flagships from the last few years. Again – properly testing that will not be easy. Also keep in mind that by default in no phone that I tested so far the highest quality is activated by default (something the article also mentioned) and in no phone that I tested so far you can make the highest-quality settings stick – so basically each time you connect your headphones you must go in developer options (which you must first enable in Android) and force the LDAC quality to the highest value. Go there and try changing quality while you listen to your favorite audio testing piece – on many phones you will instantly hear a difference (on some other phones you might need to stop the player and start again). DO YOUR OWN TESTS!

Do we have enough bandwidth for good audio? Bluetooth EDR has up to 3 Mbps but even under perfect conditions the limits for packet sending and receiving means that at the absolute most you can only reach around 2 Mbps, which would sound as perfectly acceptable. But the issue here is not the absolute bandwidth value but instead the EFFECTIVE BANDWIDTH available in specific conditions (that happen to be normal conditions for many/most people) – and here we must quickly talk about 2.4GHz radio coexistence, most notably WiFi + Bluetooth coexistence – and to get a quick start on that you can look at the main image from this page:

https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/200794267-Will-wireless-interference-and-Wi-Fi-impact-beacons-

where you will see that WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth are literally sharing the same radio bands where signals can’t really work well at the absolute same time for both (things are in fact even worse than the image since many if not most of the modern 2.4GHz WiFi access points can also use double-width channels where a single AP will in fact take over almost twice of the spectrum shown in the picture above). If you add widespread situations in populated areas like [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/LyjisTD.png) you can easily understand that radio quality can be quite a mess. You might also need to add to this mess the fact that for instance “true wireless” earbuds have tiny antennas and yet use about twice the radio bandwidth of normal headphones for the same quality (since you have one connection from your phone to one of the buds and then most often a separate connection from the first to the 2nd bud).

But this is not the entire mess or the worst part of it – the worst part of it comes since on the phone itself there is usually a hardware-level or low-level-driver level exclusion mechanism between WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth – so when both are active at the same time packets being sent over Bluetooth very frequently need to wait for WiFi activity to get to a well-defined state before being sent, and depending on how that is implemented the amount of waiting quickly becomes too long and you start losing packets and hearing “cracks” in the sound. The issue is obviously taking place less often (and somehow at a more apparently random times) on lower quality settings so if you want quickly to check that the issue is present you just need to connect some headphones on LDAC or aptxHD and crank-up quality to the maximum. You can accelerate that even more by running at the same time a bandwidth test on the 2.4GHz WiFi from the phone – I run https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest  on a local wired server on my local network and I normally get around 80 Mbps on the 2.4GHz band on most phones, but when I listen from the same phone with highest LDAC quality the WiFi speedtest collapses to 10 Mbps and most often at the same time you get to hear some skipping or cracking! Funny is that on the most recents Pixel2XL drivers+Android the speed collapses to just about 2 Mbps but there is no cracking (it was absolutely there one year or so ago), which suggests they finally got the priority order right.

**Either way in my experience the best way to minimize the issues with Bluetooth Audio skipping is to either disable completely WiFi or force a connection on a 5GHz Access Point - again DO YOUR OWN TESTS! There might still be one source of WiFi and Bluetooth interferences on Android while playing BT audio – and that is special WiFi and Bluetooth scanning as “location helper” - disable those as part of your tests and see if you get any difference. Also as a completely separate test (probably more important on “true wireless buds”) - try to see if there is any difference keeping your phone on your left vs right pocket – you might sometimes be surprised of what you will find.**

**EDIT:**

IMHO one other immediate improvement that Google **could** and **should** do with Android 11 is to use SBC standard codec in a better way as already the guys from LineageOS are doing:

&lt;p&gt;The issue for this post is Bluetooth Audio and how things on this front are far from great especially in Android. Many people already know something is not right since they always run into issues with skipping sound and bad noise or bad sound in their headphones – but to learn why that takes place and how you can avoid/improve this you will need to read to the end of this AND DO YOUR OWN TESTS YOURSELF (also that type of problems might take place even when you are OK with less than good/excellent audio compression, so it might still be worth reading anyway).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The subject of what is wrong with Bluetooth in general and audio in special is so long that can’t be covered fully in just a few paragraphs, but generally you might be having quality problems or transmission problems – if quality is not that much of an issue just skim over first part below and go to the transmission issues in the 2nd part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s first define what I am calling here good quality headphone audio – you don’t really need well-over-1000 buckaroos (name which I will use as a reference for USD in US and EUR in Europe) reference studio headphones to get good quality (you can get exceptional quality if money is no object but that is not the topic here), you can in fact get good quality starting slightly below 100 buckaroos with some good WIRED headphones. So you would expect that if you buy a wireless model that is 3-4 times more expensive you will be able to enjoy at all times about the same good audio quality – unfortunately you are definitely wrong about the “at all times” part and that might be in fact close to never by default (unless you really optimize your setup).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One quick observation – if you want to investigate audio quality the only ultra-reliable way is with special measuring device, but you can still get some decent results with your own ears (or somebody else’s “golden ears”) as long as you test properly (if your input sound is some 128 kbps MP3 or some internet streaming service you are doing it wrong, you need FLAC or other lossless sources to test properly). Your best results will come if you test comparatively almost side-by-side (or at least if you can change settings “on the fly” and you focus on how the sound changes). It is also important to know what types of the sound are most sensitive for instance to compression settings – in my experience classical music with a mix of string and brass instruments tends to show much easier differences in compression settings as a result of their much higher harmonics (if I would have to pick a single piece for testing I would pick Beethoven’s 5th in the Gardiner version with a strong accent on the finale). Most of my very recent tests have been done on Sony MDR1000X and Sony WH1000XM3 which also have their own set of quirks – in fact the older MDR1000X which are “mark 1” have a cleaner sound than the newer “mark 3” and both sound MUCH better for absolute sound quality in a quiet room with noise cancelling disabled (and powered-on even on wired tests – impedance it around 47ohm like that vs around 16ohm when non-powered); however 1000XM3 are a huge lot better on noise cancelling so for travel are vastly superior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will direct people that are newer to the topic of Bluetooth codecs to an article like this - &lt;a href=""https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/""&gt;https://www.soundguys.com/understanding-bluetooth-codecs-15352/&lt;/a&gt; - but to simplify things for the rest of this we will have to agree that you can’t have good quality beyond a certain compression level and most people (myself included) would generally consider good to very good only (optimally) compressed streams above 500 kbps, with the streams in the 250-350 kbps being rather in the range of acceptable than good to very good. People might complain that 250-320 kbps is perfectly good for them (that could be mostly the Apple people where AAC only goes as far as 250-320 kbps) and of course (and as you can see in the link provided and many other on the internet) there will be people that will consider the 500 kbps not enough and some will fault even 900+ kbps - but for the moment let’s go forward with this convention/compromise – since you might encounter problems even with that, or even with lower values and bigger compromises – and that has something to do with hardware and especially low-level driver limitations even in the most expensive flagships from the last few years. Again – properly testing that will not be easy. Also keep in mind that by default in no phone that I tested so far the highest quality is activated by default (something the article also mentioned) and in no phone that I tested so far you can make the highest-quality settings stick – so basically each time you connect your headphones you must go in developer options (which you must first enable in Android) and force the LDAC quality to the highest value. Go there and try changing quality while you listen to your favorite audio testing piece – on many phones you will instantly hear a difference (on some other phones you might need to stop the player and start again). DO YOUR OWN TESTS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do we have enough bandwidth for good audio? Bluetooth EDR has up to 3 Mbps but even under perfect conditions the limits for packet sending and receiving means that at the absolute most you can only reach around 2 Mbps, which would sound as perfectly acceptable. But the issue here is not the absolute bandwidth value but instead the EFFECTIVE BANDWIDTH available in specific conditions (that happen to be normal conditions for many/most people) – and here we must quickly talk about 2.4GHz radio coexistence, most notably WiFi + Bluetooth coexistence – and to get a quick start on that you can look at the main image from this page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/200794267-Will-wireless-interference-and-Wi-Fi-impact-beacons-""&gt;https://community.estimote.com/hc/en-us/articles/200794267-Will-wireless-interference-and-Wi-Fi-impact-beacons-&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;where you will see that WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth are literally sharing the same radio bands where signals can’t really work well at the absolute same time for both (things are in fact even worse than the image since many if not most of the modern 2.4GHz WiFi access points can also use double-width channels where a single AP will in fact take over almost twice of the spectrum shown in the picture above). If you add widespread situations in populated areas like &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/LyjisTD.png""&gt;THIS&lt;/a&gt; you can easily understand that radio quality can be quite a mess. You might also need to add to this mess the fact that for instance “true wireless” earbuds have tiny antennas and yet use about twice the radio bandwidth of normal headphones for the same quality (since you have one connection from your phone to one of the buds and then most often a separate connection from the first to the 2nd bud).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this is not the entire mess or the worst part of it – the worst part of it comes since on the phone itself there is usually a hardware-level or low-level-driver level exclusion mechanism between WiFi in 2.4GHz and Bluetooth – so when both are active at the same time packets being sent over Bluetooth very frequently need to wait for WiFi activity to get to a well-defined state before being sent, and depending on how that is implemented the amount of waiting quickly becomes too long and you start losing packets and hearing “cracks” in the sound.

My main reason for getting the S52 is due to bluetooth issues that developed on my S41( could be software, could be aging hardware but its annoying).

Current worries are battery life going from 5000mAh to 3100mAh. I was worried about the screen but even with a much lower ppi density the colours and image quality seem to be far better then the S41 I guess that's due to moving away from TFT. 

Headphone and charging port do not have covers like the S41 which after 2 years I don't trust mine anymore.

,Android,"Firstly I know COVID is a thing. But it wasn't a thing for the entire 3.5+ years since the first version. And Apple and Samsung have both launched multiple products over the last few months without significant issues.

Google clearly has a problem shipping products and I'd be interested to know why this never seems to improve. I don't know how they expect to gain market share by consistently releasing things that are mildly over-priced, and unavailable to most of the world. You can't catch up by going slower than everyone else.

It's not like this is their first swing at this. They've been shipping a huge variety of products for half a decade, and still don't seem to have this ironed out. 

It doesn't make any sense. Why do they keep spending all this time, money, and engineering effort building something and then knee-cap it on launch. It's like they want it to exist, but don't seem to care at all if it's successful.

They have all the resources in the world to make this successful if they wanted to. They own the software, the hardware, and all of the services, and even the datacenters that the services run on.

But it wasn&amp;#39;t a thing for the entire 3.5+ years since the first version. And Apple and Samsung have both launched multiple products over the last few months without significant issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google clearly has a problem shipping products and I&amp;#39;d be interested to know why this never seems to improve. I don&amp;#39;t know how they expect to gain market share by consistently releasing things that are mildly over-priced, and unavailable to most of the world. You can&amp;#39;t catch up by going slower than everyone else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not like this is their first swing at this. They&amp;#39;ve been shipping a huge variety of products for half a decade, and still don&amp;#39;t seem to have this ironed out. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t make any sense. Why do they keep spending all this time, money, and engineering effort building something and then knee-cap it on launch. It&amp;#39;s like they want it to exist, but don&amp;#39;t seem to care at all if it&amp;#39;s successful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They have all the resources in the world to make this successful if they wanted to. They own the software, the hardware, and all of the services, and even the datacenters that the services run on. They have some of the best engineers in the world, they have been building their own servers and other hardware for a decade. They hold all the cards, and still do basically nothing.&lt;/p&gt;

,Android,"About a week ago I decided to switch back to 3-button navigation just to see how much different it was now compared to the gesture navigation that I've gotten used to on my Pixel 3.

To my surprise, I found that it was just way easier to use. Going Home was faster, swiping the slideout menus were easier and less error prone, double tap to flip apps was super quick, accessing the Assistant made more sense. It just all worked.

Not only that but it really just feels like a signature part of Android. If you see someone with the three icons at the bottom of the screen, you instantly know they're an Android user. And if they're filled in, you further instantly know they're a Pixel user.

I'm glad that they brought back the option to use 3-button Nav in Android 10, but I'm worried that it's only a temporary option and it'll be gone in Android 11 or 12. The new ""smaller"" Assistant is only available in gesture nav, and it makes me think what else they'll remove if you're using the 3-button Nav.

I think it is more clear than ever how detached this sub is from reality. The common person that Google is targeting knows nothing and does not care about the technical aspects that are frequently upvoted to the top. The common person picks up a Google phone and says ""Huh, this phone was made by the company that provides the services I use on a daily basis"" and plays with the phone for a bit. They like the smoothness, the camera, and the look, and they buy. It really is that simple.

Google isn't targeting the enthusiasts. The OnePlus phones will always be the enthusiast phone. The Pixel 4 will guaranteed and without a doubt be the most popular Pixel to date, just by virtue of the fact that it now available in every phone carrier nationwide. 90%+ of the entire population buys their phones by walking in the store and playing with them.

People here are expecting the Pixel to sell iPhone levels while it was on 1 carrier and in way less countries. The entire point of Google's slow rollout on Verizon was to ensure they maintain the leverage to keep the carrier from adding their bloatware to the phones (see latest report that AT&amp;T Pixels are bloatware free). Google and Apple are the only two manufacturers that were able to pull this off.

I know its a meme on this sub to claim that all the 14-year olds could run Google better than they can, which is most evident in the constant bitching about shutting down services that nobody uses and nobody (besides Google) has data on how many people were even actively using.

,Android,"This is in response to the Samsung's Qihoo 360 case. For those who don't know, there's a sensational post last week on Reddit, as a user claimed that Samsung partnered with a Chinese company Qihoo and pre-installed irremovable ""spyware"" on every Samsung phone and tablet. Long story short, I found the post to be jumping to conclusions, but Samsung's response later seemed a little fishy to me. Being a network security researcher, I went ahead and decompiled the APK myself. Though I'd like to believe Samsung, it is however proven that the Device Care app is **RECORDING IMEIs and SENDING BACK Uniquely Identifiable IDs back to Qihoo's server**. The findings I'm about to spill out can be repeated and is verifiable by anyone. Don't believe my words? Download the APK and decompile it following these steps. You will see the exact same code as me.

I uploaded the Device Care APK to the JADX Decompiler ([http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk](http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk)) and downloaded the files. Here are decompiled code in the following screenshots:  
[https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m](https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m)

Just see the screenshots yourselves. You don't need to be a tech wizard to see that **IMEI** is being fetched (3rd screenshot and 4th screenshot) and **Unique Identifiable ID** is being sent to Qihoo's servers (1st screenshot). In the last screenshot, you can even see that the CPU model, whether the user is using WIFI, the free storage space on your phone were also being sent to Qihoo's servers, but I guess that's already nothing compared to your IMEI and Uniquely Identifiable ID. Samsung is obviously deceiving the Android community, hoping we'll just take their word for it.

Among the decompiled files, there's an entire library (which served as a codebase for apps) that's called libmobilesafe360\_clear-jni-6.7.so. I also decompiled that library, using another decompiler ([https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/](https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/)). The library contains the **exact same encryption keys** (the generation seed:  70&gt;@|:CF0z€.97:M0z|ovyrM) for encrypting HTTP traffic (yup, they would rather encrypt it using their own algorithm than using HTTPS) using the DES algorithm **as** the ones that was included in **360's contacts backup application.** This DES encryption key was proven by Chinese security researchers to be easily cracked and intercepted.

The final nail to the coffin for me to find out Samsung is lying is that the User-Agent string in the packets that were sent back to the server was straight up called ""**360clearsdk**"". How could this possibly be if Samsung was using their own code and was simply ""downloading Qihoo's definition database"" as they claimed?

Last but not least, though I guess this evidence is already not needed, this is the permission that the Device Care app has access to on my phone:  [https://imgur.com/e43NJQx](https://imgur.com/e43NJQx) . Notice the ""Phone"" permission. This is a clear telltale sign for apps to gather IMEI information.

I took a look back at Samsung's statements. At first, their respond on the Korean forum Naver was this one [https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese\_spyware\_preinstalled\_on\_all\_samsung/fdggokk](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese_spyware_preinstalled_on_all_samsung/fdggokk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) , which basically says only the filtering database was being downloaded from Qihoo's server. After the original post has gained notoriety and people start demanding the removal of the app, Samsung told The Verge a completely different story: "" *The storage optimization process, including the scanning and removal of junk files, is fully managed by Samsung’s device care solution.* "" Note how their statement has changed. Samsung now didn't claim that the app was fully made by them, but rather using an ambiguous sentence ""...*is fully managed by Samsung's device care solution"",* which basically completely avoided answering the question directly.

Conclusion:  
Hard facts, which can be verified by anyone interested:  
1. The IMEI is being collected and Uniquely Identifiable ID was being sent to Qihoo's 360 server,  
2. The encryption key that Qihoo was using in its contacts backup app for Chinese domestic users is also used in the Device Care app. Since it uses HTTP, a malicious user can intercept the traffic, decrypt the packets following the guides written by Chinese security researchers, and retrieve your uniquely identifiable ID and IMEI,  
3. In summary of 1. and 2., this basically means that not only are Samsung and Qihoo 360 collecting your personal identifiable information (which possibly violates GDPR and many states' privacy laws in the US), they are also doing it in an extremely insecure way and hackers can eavesdrop these information.

Speculation:  
1. Since this issue has been brought up time after time before (though none has reached this time's popularity), Samsung quiets down the controversy by lying again and again. They probably bet the users are not technically proficient enough to decompile the code themselves.

Last but not least, yes, this is a new account, but a throwaway one. I am a network security researcher at a major international InfoSec company, and decompiling code may violate IP laws and perhaps a ton of ToS. I simply want the truth to be out there. I have also sent the above findings to various major media outlets. I just hope that Samsung could stop lying to the r/Android community, and tell us the entire truth.

For those who don&amp;#39;t know, there&amp;#39;s a sensational post last week on Reddit, as a user claimed that Samsung partnered with a Chinese company Qihoo and pre-installed irremovable &amp;quot;spyware&amp;quot; on every Samsung phone and tablet. Long story short, I found the post to be jumping to conclusions, but Samsung&amp;#39;s response later seemed a little fishy to me. Being a network security researcher, I went ahead and decompiled the APK myself. Though I&amp;#39;d like to believe Samsung, it is however proven that the Device Care app is &lt;strong&gt;RECORDING IMEIs and SENDING BACK Uniquely Identifiable IDs back to Qihoo&amp;#39;s server&lt;/strong&gt;. The findings I&amp;#39;m about to spill out can be repeated and is verifiable by anyone. Don&amp;#39;t believe my words? Download the APK and decompile it following these steps. You will see the exact same code as me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I uploaded the Device Care APK to the JADX Decompiler (&lt;a href=""http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk""&gt;http://www.javadecompilers.com/apk&lt;/a&gt;) and downloaded the files. Here are decompiled code in the following screenshots:&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/2aVe19m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just see the screenshots yourselves. You don&amp;#39;t need to be a tech wizard to see that &lt;strong&gt;IMEI&lt;/strong&gt; is being fetched (3rd screenshot and 4th screenshot) and &lt;strong&gt;Unique Identifiable ID&lt;/strong&gt; is being sent to Qihoo&amp;#39;s servers (1st screenshot). In the last screenshot, you can even see that the CPU model, whether the user is using WIFI, the free storage space on your phone were also being sent to Qihoo&amp;#39;s servers, but I guess that&amp;#39;s already nothing compared to your IMEI and Uniquely Identifiable ID. Samsung is obviously deceiving the Android community, hoping we&amp;#39;ll just take their word for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among the decompiled files, there&amp;#39;s an entire library (which served as a codebase for apps) that&amp;#39;s called libmobilesafe360_clear-jni-6.7.so. I also decompiled that library, using another decompiler (&lt;a href=""https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/""&gt;https://onlinedisassembler.com/odaweb/&lt;/a&gt;). The library contains the &lt;strong&gt;exact same encryption keys&lt;/strong&gt; (the generation seed:  70&amp;gt;@|:CF0z€.97:M0z|ovyrM) for encrypting HTTP traffic (yup, they would rather encrypt it using their own algorithm than using HTTPS) using the DES algorithm &lt;strong&gt;as&lt;/strong&gt; the ones that was included in &lt;strong&gt;360&amp;#39;s contacts backup application.&lt;/strong&gt; This DES encryption key was proven by Chinese security researchers to be easily cracked and intercepted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final nail to the coffin for me to find out Samsung is lying is that the User-Agent string in the packets that were sent back to the server was straight up called &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;360clearsdk&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;. How could this possibly be if Samsung was using their own code and was simply &amp;quot;downloading Qihoo&amp;#39;s definition database&amp;quot; as they claimed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, though I guess this evidence is already not needed, this is the permission that the Device Care app has access to on my phone:  &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/e43NJQx""&gt;https://imgur.com/e43NJQx&lt;/a&gt; . Notice the &amp;quot;Phone&amp;quot; permission. This is a clear telltale sign for apps to gather IMEI information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a look back at Samsung&amp;#39;s statements. At first, their respond on the Korean forum Naver was this one &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese_spyware_preinstalled_on_all_samsung/fdggokk?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x""&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/ektg8u/chinese_spyware_preinstalled_on_all_samsung/fdggokk&lt;/a&gt; , which basically says only the filtering database was being downloaded from Qihoo&amp;#39;s server. After the original post has gained notoriety and people start demanding the removal of the app, Samsung told The Verge a completely different story: &amp;quot; &lt;em&gt;The storage optimization process, including the scanning and removal of junk files, is fully managed by Samsung’s device care solution.&lt;/em&gt; &amp;quot; Note how their statement has changed. Samsung now didn&amp;#39;t claim that the app was fully made by them, but rather using an ambiguous sentence &amp;quot;...&lt;em&gt;is fully managed by Samsung&amp;#39;s device care solution&amp;quot;,&lt;/em&gt; which basically completely avoided answering the question directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br/&gt;
Hard facts, which can be verified by anyone interested:&lt;br/&gt;
1. The IMEI is being collected and Uniquely Identifiable ID was being sent to Qihoo&amp;#39;s 360 server,&lt;br/&gt;
2. The encryption key that Qihoo was using in its contacts backup app for Chinese domestic users is also used in the Device Care app. Since it uses HTTP, a malicious user can intercept the traffic, decrypt the packets following the guides written by Chinese security researchers, and retrieve your uniquely identifiable ID and IMEI,&lt;br/&gt;
3. In summary of 1. and 2., this basically means that not only are Samsung and Qihoo 360 collecting your personal identifiable information (which possibly violates GDPR and many states&amp;#39; privacy laws in the US), they are also doing it in an extremely insecure way and hackers can eavesdrop these information.&lt;/p&gt;

Edit: I wanted to explain how the widgets worked, the music player widget can play next/previous songs by click either side, clicking the middle would play/pause the song. The weather widget will change based on weather and day/night. The new widget on the bottom will change the topic when you click on it.

Now I get maximum 9 apps on my freakin 6.5 inch smartphone screen. Does Google think I'm blind or something? Why do app icons need to be this big? The text area for the app name is even partially off-screen at the bottom. I realise that each device has a different DPI but c'mon, why aren't we at least allowed to change the size of these icons ourselves?

As for the front page, I mean look at this... 2.65 apps displayed? One is even a video (bottom off-screen app). We already have ""Google Play Games"" where this garbage should be displayed. Is it crazy to say they should be separate and that not every Android user plays games?

Who is the idiot in charge of UI/UX at Google's Android department? Next update we're going to what, one app per entire device display window huh?

EDIT: I forgot to show this one too. Of both the above things, this is actually perhaps the worst change of all as it is actually malicious. Showing me completely unrelated apps at the top of the screen even when I searched for something totally different. The proximity of the ""Install"" button, next to the magnifying button for searching is deliberately so close as to make the user mistakenly tap ""Install"". If the app is small and your connection fast, it will be installed almost instantly. This is literally [Clickjacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking).

,Android,"Yesterday I ended up losing my Galaxy S9 inside my apartment's hallway, and apparently one of my neighbors took it (probably to keep it safe, rather than steal). Anyways, I panicked and I used both Samsung's and Google's Find My Phone features. Here is what I found to be way better on Samsung's version:

* You can actually prevent the other person from turning off your phone.
* You can track their location and keep the location history. It shows up nicely on the web map too.
* You can back up your phone remotely to Samsung Cloud (15 GB free).
* You can retrieve calls/messages.
* You can trigger the maximum power saving mode remotely.
* The Web UI is simpler and nicer imo.

The main issue with Google's version is, if the person just turns off your phone, you are done. You can't do anything anymore. With Samsung's version, you can enable maximum power saving mode AND prevent the person from turning off your phone.

,Android,"IFTTT has moved to a monthly subscription model. They are restricting the basic free accounts to a maximum of 3 custom applets.

The pricing is $9.99 per month, but until october they are offering pay what you want pricing (from $1.99) which will work for the first year only.

As of right now they are not removing any applets you have created over the 3 applet limit on a free account, and these applets seem to be working still. But no telling how long that lasts.

This is really sad news for me, I had a few applets set up, and have used IFTTT for a long time. I had always been keen for a pro model which allowed for additional features, but never thought it would be this much, and didn't think they'd lock the existing features behind a paywall as well.

,Android,"Ice Universe, the well known Samsung leaker, stated a year ago that Samsung has the exclusive OLED laser hole punching technology for some time ([source](https://twitter.com/universeice/status/1065053321814138881?lang=en)). This is the reason why the Galaxy flagships were the only phones using OLED with hole-punch. We did see a few Chinese phones using the hole punch, but they all used an LCD display, which uses a different cutting method for the hole punch.

This year we saw OnePlus using pop-up cameras, others that have neither the pop-up or hole-punch tech keeping the notch and a few others like the Pixel embracing the forehead.

All this is predicted to change as Samsung's OLED hole punch exclusivity wears off. The Pixel 4A's render shows it will be using a hole punch display, and the same goes for the OnePlus 8 rumors and leaks. Pixel 5 and the next iPhone will likely follow suit.

,Android,"OnePlus recently added a [subsection to their forum](https://forums.oneplus.com/forums/ideas/) named [""IDEAS""](https://www.oneplus.in/communityideas#/). They stated the goal was to take the best ideas by listening to their community and implementing it on their products. They actually went out of their way to explain their thought process behind some of the ideas they accepted and also provided an explanation for some ideas that were rejected. 

One of the [ideas](https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/allow-user-to-choose-which-stock-apps-they-want-to-install-during-set-up.1174902/) was allowing users their choice of apps while setting up the phone. They rejected the idea saying they couldn't do that since users expect certain applications like the clock, calculator and gallery to work out of the box. However they also justified the addition of third party bloatware like Netflix and Facebook by saying they were added for enhancing HDR video playback and higher battery efficiency as they were popular with their users. 

I honestly don't know why a company would try to justify the addition of third party apps when it's obvious it's being done for other reasons as those apps are available on the Play Store should someone want to install them. It probably would have been better for them to not mention that bit at all.

,Android,"Can we talk about the elephant in the room? Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, deliberately lowers quality of uploads for Android users, compression happens on the server side, so there is no excuse, also they are using the same version of libx264, so again no excuse.

Does Apple pays Instagram to do this? Is this legal?

Why Does smartphone reviewers like /u/Marques-Brownlee , /u/ThisIsTechToday , UnboxTherapy never talk about this?

If is not illegal and it is not a disloyal, unfair action, why Google doesn't do the same for YouTube? Like deliberately lowers the quality of whatever it is uploaded from an iPhone or any other Apple product?

Here is a link of an article written in spanish that made some tests to prove what I’m saying.

[https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion](https://www.xatakamovil.com/aplicaciones/instagram-para-android-procesa-peor-imagenes-videos-ponemos-a-prueba-aplicacion)

Basically, doesn't matter what you use to shoot a video, even if you use a Red Camera, or a Canon DSLR, even if you shoot your videos on an iPhone! if you upload that video using an Android it will look like garbage, if you upload exactly the same video using iPhone it will look crystal clear.

Tik Tok for example doesn't do this, and the overall quality of the app looks a lot much better than Instagram because of the same reason, Android and Apple users can upload crystal clear videos if they have a good camera.

Why nobody is complaining? I love pixel phones, and I love the camera picture style, but there is no sense on having this quality if I can not share it with anyone.

If this was fixed a lot of people, influencers, and creatives will be able to switch to Android.

“Happiness is only real, when shared""

EDIT: 
Please be aware that I'm not talking about recording video with the integrated camera app, I understand all the hardware variations that this involves and how hard it can be to achieve homogeneous results. I'm talking about uploading a video recorded with another app or device, using the app only as an uploader, shouldn't produce different results as the compression happens server side using the same version of x264 library.

EDIT2:
Someone suggested to use Instander, an instagram mod which can manipulate some flags inside the app, one of this flags is able to override the video upload quality bitrate, I try this with the suggested value of 10mb, and it really worked, the uploaded result looks a lot more sharper https://imgur.com/a/vya4QKs I will try a higher bitrate to see how hi can I go up, this also proves that it is just a setting and not a hardware variation in smartphones what is causing this as a lot of people suggest. I understand some phones might struggle with higher bitrates, but instagram could at least try higher values for latest processor chips, and not just put one low setting for everybody.

Another tool that yield interesting results was Inssist a chrome instagram client extension, you can upload stories and videos directly from your computer, however I found that this videos had to be carefully crafted, with a bitrate not very high so instagram don't compress them a lot, and not so low so they don't look ugly, in my tests using ffmpeg to encode the videos before uploading with a CRF of 20 or a 12mb VBR(6457k) yield very good results depending on the duration and darkness of the videos.",t2_5qcnwfnx,False,,0,False,"Happiness is only real, when shared.

As you can see It is very insufficient. Google really needs to put more effort into getting the technology featured on all OEM TWS, like Galaxy Buds, Huawei Freebuds, Oppo Enco Free, Xiaomi Airdots, not to mention premiums TWS from Bose, Jabra, Sony and Seinnheiser.

&gt;Is OnePlus not putting out annual reports because they are afraid the reports will be received badly?

&gt;Not giving out information about, for example, financial details stimulates speculation about what the facts are.

&gt;[It sure does.](https://forums.oneplus.net/threads/manufacturing-costs.838/#post-33841) Especially for a company like OnePlus that was built upon profitless growth.

I linked to a OnePlus Forums post ([#9 in the thread](http://archive.is/hqszU)) made by Carl saying:

&gt;We will not have a profit margin on the OnePlus One, and are planning a cost breakdown infographic to prove this. Stay tuned. :)

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wondered what comprised the $50 difference between the 16 GB and 64 GB OPO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I linked to a OnePlus Forums post (&lt;a href=""http://archive.is/hqszU""&gt;#9 in the thread&lt;/a&gt;) made by Carl saying:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will not have a profit margin on the OnePlus One, and are planning a cost breakdown infographic to prove this. Stay tuned. :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

My main issues are:

* For You has been intentionally removed to being a desktop site only feature. 
* The way historical photos are shown is now a forced slideshow instead of just letting you open a pic and look at it for as long as you want.
* If you want to create something, it's all hidden away under Library&gt; Utilities. 
* If you want to create a movie you now *only* have the option to do so in portrait mode, even if the original video is in landscape. 
* I don't like the new logo (not the biggest issue, to be fair) :-)

,Android,"After being disappointed by Samsung's hyped up S20 Ultra camera, which I had high hopes for, I decided to bust out my old Nokia 808 PureView to compare to my Google Pixel.

I know this an Android subreddit, but we discuss cameras quite often here and I just wanted to give the old king a shoutout (plus I'm comparing it to an Android phone).

This cameraphone just never fails to amaze me with its quality. I don't know what sorcery Nokia were doing in their labs but 808 is a special masterpiece.

Here's a comparison:

A back camera was used for both cameras.

Pair 1: [Google Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/T46740r.jpg), [808 PureView](https://i.imgur.com/875qsmU.jpg)

Pair 2: [Google Pixel](https://i.imgur.com/MKrlcmc.jpg), [808 PureView](https://i.imgur.com/jXpSXkS.jpg)

[Direct, 100% cropped comparison](https://i.imgur.com/Am2Y21b.jpg)

Look at them on a monitor at 100% resolution to really see the difference.

The level of difference in a natural look and just sheer details between a Google Pixel, which is one of the best camera phones on the market and Nokia 808 PureView is incredible!

In daylight, there is absolutely nothing that matches 808. It still has the largest sensor (not counting Panasonic CM1, which was more of a camera than a phone and 808 still produced better images). The sensor, lens and processing combination is still unmatched. No other cameraphone produces these soft, pleasing, yet highly detailed and realistic images 808 does.

If S20 Ultra came at least a bit close to this, I would have bought it.

It saddens me that this kinda of detail might never be matched or at least it will take a long, long time to match this. This phone is already 8 years old.

,Android,"I know the title is rather sensational, however it couldn't get any closer to the truth.

For those who are too busy to read the whole post, here's the TL;DR version: **The   storage scanner in the Device Care section is made by a super shady   Chinese data-mining/antivirus company called Qihoo 360. It comes   pre-installed on your Samsung phone or tablet, communicates with Chinese   servers, and you CANNOT REMOVE it** (unless using ADB or other means).

This   is by no means signaling hate toward Samsung. I have ordered the  Galaxy  S10+ once it's available in my region and I'm very happy with  it. I  have been a long time lurker on [r/samsung](https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/) and [r/galaxys10](https://www.reddit.com/r/galaxys10/)  reading tips and tricks about my phone. However, I want to detail my  point of view on this situation.

For   those who don't know, there's a Device Care function in Settings. For   me, it's very useful for optimizing my battery usage and I believe most   users have a positive feedback about this addition that Samsung has  put  in our devices. With that being said, I want to go into details   regarding the storage cleaner inside Device Care.

If   you go inside the Storage section of Device Care, you'll see a very   tiny printed line ""powered by 360"". Those in the west may not be   familiar with this company, but it's a very shady company from China   that has utilized many dirty tricks to attempt getting a larger market   share. Its antivirus (for PC) is so notorious that it has garnered a   meme status in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other Chinese speaking   countries' Internet communities. For example, 360 Antivirus on PC would   ACTIVELY search for and mark other competitors' products as a threat  and  remove them. Others include force installation of 360's browser  bars,  using misleading advertisements (e.g. those 'YOUR DEVICE HAS 2  VIRUSES,  DOWNLOAD OUR APP TO SCAN NOW' ads). These tactics has even got  the  attention of the Chinese government, and several court cases has  already  been opened in China to address 360's terrible business deeds.  (On the  Chinese version of Wikipedia you can read further about the  long list of  their terrible misconducts, but there's already many on  its English  Wikipedia page: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo\_360](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qihoo_360)).

If   the company's ethics are not troublesome enough, let me introduce you   to the 'Spyware' allegation I made in the title. A news report from the   Chinese government's mouthpiece ChinaDaily back in 2017 reveals 360's   plan to partner up with the government to provide more big data   insights. In another Taiwanese news report back in 2014, 360's executive   even admits that **360 would hand the data over to the Chinese government whenever he is asked to** in an interview ([https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998](https://www.ithome.com.tw/news/89998)). The Storage scanner on your phone **have full access to all your personal data** (since it's part of the system), and **by Chinese laws and regulations, would send these data to the government when required**.

With   that in mind, for those who know intermediate computer networking, I   setup a testing environment on my laptop with Wireshark trying to   capture the packets and see what domains my phone are talking to. I head   over to Device Care's storage section and tapped update database (this   manual update function seems to be missing from One UI 2.0), and  voila, I  immediately saw my phone communicating to many Chinese servers   (including 360 \[dot\] cn, wshifen \[dot\] com). I have collected the   packets and import them into NetworkMiner, here's the screenshot of the   domains: [https://imgur.com/EtfInqv](https://imgur.com/EtfInqv).   Unfortunately I wasn't able to parse what exactly was transferred to   the servers, since it would require me to do a man in a middle attack on   my phone which required root access (and rooting seemed to be   impossible on my Snapdragon variant). If you have a deeper knowledge   about how to parse the encrypted packets, please let me know.

Some   may say that it's paranoia, but please think about it. Being the   digital dictatorship that is the Chinese government, it can force 360 to   push an update to the storage scanner and scan for files that are   against their sentiment, marking these users on their ""Big Data   platform"", and then swiftly remove all traces through another update.   OnePlus has already done something similar by pushing a sketchy   Clipboard Capturer to beta versions of Oxygen OS (which compared   clipboard contents to a 'badword' list), and just call it a mistake   later. Since it's close source, we  may really know what's being   transmitted to the said servers. Maybe it was simply contacting the   servers for updates and sending none of our personal data, but this may   change anytime (considering 360's notorious history).

I   discovered that the Device Care could not even be disabled in  Settings.  I went ahead and bought an app called PD MDM (not available  on Play  Store) and it can disable builtin packages without root (by  abusing  Samsung's Knox mechanism, I assume). However I suffered a great  battery  performance loss by disabling the package, since the battery  optimizer  is also disabled too.

After  a bit  of digging, the storage cleaning in Device Care seemed to be  present for  a long time, but I'm not sure since which version of  Android. It  previously seemed to be handled by another sketchy Chinese  company  called JinShan (but that's another story), but got replaced by  360  recently.

Personally,  I'm  extremely disappointed in Samsung's business decision. I didn't  know  about 360 software's presence on my phone until I bought it, and no   information was ever mentioned about 360 in the initial Setup screen. I   could have opted for a OnePlus or Xiaomi with the same specs and   spending much less money, but I chose Samsung for its premium build   quality, and of course, less involvement from the Chinese government. **We,   as consumers, paid a premium on our devices, but why are we exposed to   the same privacy threats rampant on Chinese phone brands?** I  get  it that Samsung somehow has to monetize their devices with   partnerships, but please, partner with a much more reputable company.   Even Chinese's Internet users show a great distrust about the Qihoo 360   company, how can we trust this shady and sketchy company's software   running on our devices?

This is   not about politics, and for those who say 'USA is doing the same, why   aren't you triggered?', I want to clarify that, no, if the same type of   behavior is observed on USA companies, I will be equally upset. As for   those who have the ""nothing to hide"" mentality, you can buy a Chinese   phone brand anytime you like. That is your choice. We choose Samsung   because we believe it stand by its values, but this is a clear violation   of this kind of trust.

**If you share the same concern, please, let our voices be heard by Samsung.**   I love Reddit and I believe it's a great way to get the community's   attention about this issue. Our personal data is at great risk.  
To Samsung, if you're reading this, please **1.) Partner with an entirely different company or 2.) At least make the Storage scanner optional for us**.

**Relevance to Android:**

Think of all the Android apps/software you use that use encryption. If this bill passes, all such software made by American companies or organizations (Signal, Whatsapp, etc.), would be illegal (at least for Americans) unless the software had a backdoor built into it for the US government to be able to access the encrypted data.

The law establishes a precedent for other nations to follow, and for further legislation to be passed, such as requiring encryption data to be unencrypted on demand (like in Australia), or outlawing encryption outright. The EFF has already spoken out about it (it's even worse than the EARN IT Act from three months ago). For these reasons, even non-Americans should be concerned.

It does nothing to stop criminals, either. They will continue downloading and using encrypted software, or encrypting data on backdoored devices. All it will do is give a **huge** blow to average Americans who use American software. There will be obvious security problems having a built-in backdoor (criminals and hackers would exploit it), and the bill would set the precedent that encryption and privacy are bad/illegal/etc. Many businesses might leave the country, and people would lose their privacy.

**If you are an American:**

[Contact your two US senators](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm). Tell them to vote **NO** on the **Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act**

,Android,"There is an upcoming change to the YouTube ToS that states that:

&gt;YouTube may terminate your access, or your **Google account’s** access to all or part of the Service if YouTube believes, in its sole discretion, that provision of the Service to you is no longer commercially viable.

While this wording is (probably intentionally) vague, it could mean bad things for anyone using ad block, YT Vanced, etc if Google decides that you're not ""commercially viable"". I know that personally, I would be *screwed* if I lost my Google account.

If you think this is not worth worrying about, look at what Google has just done to hundreds of people that were using (apparently) too many emotes in a YT live stream chat that Markiplier just did. They've banned/closed people's entire Google accounts and are denying appeals, and it's hurting people in very real ways. Here is [Markiplier's tweet/vid](https://twitter.com/markiplier/status/1193015864364126208) about it for more info.

It's pretty scary the direction Google is going, and I think we should all reevaluate how much we rely on their services. They could pull the rug out from under you and leave you with no recourse, so it's definitely something to be aware of.

EDIT: I see the mods have tagged this ""misleading"", and I'm not sure why. Not my intention, just trying to give people the heads up that the ToS are changing and it *could* be bad. The fact that the verbiage is so vague, combined with Google/YouTube's past actions - it's worth being aware of and best to err on the side of caution IMO.

,Android,"Let's say the speculation ends up being true and the 2021 iPhone will have no ports. Now, I couldn't care less about what features the iPhone has or doesn't have. I use an Android phone. What I do care about, is that Android phone manufacturers have a bit of a reputation for blindly copying Apple in hopes that making the same mistakes as Apple will make them successful. But I digress.

When you think about it, this situation seems eerily similar to the headphone jack going extinct: Apple realized, that they could make a lot more money by selling expensive Bluetooth earbuds, rather than cheap wired ones, so they removed the headphone jack. And soon, nearly every other manufacturer followed suit.

What I'm afraid of, is that the same thing will happen all over again; Apple removes the charging port, creates an expensive, proprietary wireless charger, and others follow along a couple years later.

Now, you could argue that removing the charging port is just so utterly ridiculous, that no other manufacturer would be insane enough to remove it. But, isn't that exactly what we said about the headphone jack?

My point is, that if Apple does end up removing the charging port, we have to make it damn clear to our favorite phone manufacturers, that we won't let them get away with it.

It is said that the result of the inquiry from Samsung Members Korea.

&amp;#x200B;

The answer is that it does not use any function of 360 Security app, but outsourcing only DB checking for unnecessary files.

&amp;#x200B;

Deletion logic is handled by Samsung's logic, and it is said that 360 DB is used to check the Junk File that can delete files.

&amp;#x200B;

In fact, Microsoft's Windows Defender also uses the Cloud method.

,Android,"When Apple introduced the new iPad Air with the fingerprint sensor embedded at the power button, [CNET](https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-integrates-touch-id-fingerprint-unlock-into-top-button-on-new-ipad-air/) said the following:

""Android device makers, like Samsung, have included fingerprint unlocking technology in buttons on the sides of their phones for years""

It's kinda unfortunate that Samsung got mentioned first but it was Sony who popularized the side-mounted fingerprint reader in [2015](https://www.androidcentral.com/setting-and-using-fingerprint-scanner-sony-xperia-z5)! Now, Xiaomi, Motorola and others are utilizing the side mounted fp readers in their new phones. 

Some of the popular features that we take for granted in Android has been introduced/popularized by Sony like IP-water resistance (as [early as 2013 in Xperia Z](https://techland.time.com/2013/07/10/sony-xperia-z-review/) , extra-tall displays, Stamina mode for battery longevity, 960fps recording etc.. Also, Sony has contributed so much to the Android AOSP and features such as[ Android theming](https://www.androidcentral.com/waiting-dawn-new-android-theming-era)  and [high res Bluetooth audio ](https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/21/15004562/sony-google-android-o-ldac-wireless-music) was borne out of Sony's contributions. 

Hopefully, more Android makers will adopt Sony's [charge and play](https://www.xda-developers.com/sony-xperia-1-ii-gaming-feature-charge-and-play-without-degrading-battery-health-h-s-power-control/amp/) battery mode, as it will help the battery.

Sony phones are so underrated.

,Android,"I know Samsung for the great phones and the software support they provide. All was well until the March Security update for Galaxy Note 9. Then, a lot of the devices displays started breaking. Displays overheated, and started turning green/yellowish green. 

Obviously, a lot of users started complaining regarding this. After all, an issue due to a software update can be fixed by software, right? Apparently not, because sending the logs to their team through the internal bug reporting app led to no answers but generic ones like ""Reset your device"". Obviously, resetting the device did not work.

This is similar to the display issues plaguing the new Samsung phones like Galaxy S20, but which cannot be fixed by a software update.

Unfortunately, Samsung still does not admit the fault is due to the update, even though this problem is reported by hundreds of users across the world. While trying to find a fix for this problem (when I thought it could be fixed by a software update), I managed to find a telegram group: (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

Looking through the messages, I found that Samsung asked the users to get their display replaced by paying for it which costs nearly 1/3rd of the price of the phone. Not to mention the Note 9 is a ""premium"" line of phones marketed by Samsung, and has not even completed 2 years from its launch. For a ""premium phone"", one would expect the device to last 2 years at the very least, even though the warranty covers 1 year. Not all of the users will buy the phone at launch, so most of the users are now out of warranty -- and the display is broken. 

And Samsung is deliberately trying to suppress the issue (possibly to prevent bad publicity during the impending launch of their new phones). When I tweeted to them about the problems that I was facing, Samsung support asked me to DM. When I refused, because the problem needed to be public, they just spit out the link to find a nearest service centre. And then they deleted those tweets. I have had no response since.

2 days ago, when the phone became progressively unusable, I decided to submit the same to the Service Centre. I then get a call saying Samsung has released an internal guideline to all the Service Centres to fix the phones having the issue under warranty, but only if the body is free of any dents. When I asked the technicians to share the document, they refused saying that it's an internal document. This confirms that Samsung knows about the issue, but is deliberately denying users a fix in order to prevent bad publicity. Moreover, asking to fix only the phones without any dents disqualifies most phone owners. Samsung is basically telling the users -- ""We will fix the phones only if they are as good as new"" -- for a phone which customers have bought since 2 years ago.

More details are available in the telegram group:  (edit: removed link due to the group admins' complaint. He suggests to fill up the Google form https://forms.gle/v9uKokPz2kY4tnRf7 so that the same can be used against complaints to Samsung. Group link is shared upon successful submission)

,Android,"I have compiled a set of tweaks that I have done over time to get the best out of my Android. This includes getting rid of ads, reducing bloatware, focusing on privacy, getting more performance and battery life. Most of this are focused on non-rooted phones, there are better alternatives if you are rooted.

 Feel free to add your own tips below and I will add them here. 

1. **Debloating:** Many OEMs will have a lot of apps preloaded like Facebook, Microsoft, Google apps, and their own apps. These can be removed through ADB. This is safe and can be reinstalled easily if needed.  
Enable developer options by clicking the build number seven times and enable USB Debugging. Install ADB on your PC, connect your phone to PC and run **adb shell pm list packages** to list all your packages.   
To remove a package run **adb shell pm uninstall -k --user 0 &lt;package\_name&gt;.** You can find a list of bloatware list for your device / OEM from xda-developers (Eg. [Note 10 bloatware list](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-note-10/how-to/galaxy-note-10-note-10-plus-debloat-t3964225))


2. **Privacy:** 
   1. **App permissions:** App permissions are bundled under a single category now under Android-10. Permissions can be removed for apps that don't need them. Or better, removing permissions can be automated with [**Bouncer**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.samruston.permission&amp;hl=en_IN) 
   2. More privacy options can be found in settings / app-settings through which you can turn off personalized ads.
   3. **Disposable email-ids:** Temporary email addresses can be created with apps like [**Temp Mail**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tempmail&amp;hl=en_IN) if an app or website forces you to login.
   4. Use password managers and two factor authentications ([**Bitwarden**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden&amp;hl=en_IN) and [**andOTP**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.shadowice.flocke.andotp&amp;hl=en_IN)) for secure logins.
   5. Prefer open-source alternatives instead of apps that collect your personal data.
   6. **Firewall:** I recommend [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**.** This blocks Internet access to apps that can function without internet (like Calculator, Camera, Gallery, Video / Music players). Netguard can also block ads and trackers (see below).


3. **Ad-blocking:** Before getting into this, I'd suggest buying a pro-version or supporting the developer directly whenever possible.
   1. There are ad-blocking apps like [**Blokada**](https://blokada.org/index.html) **/** [**DNS66**](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.jak_linux.dns66/) that uses VPN to block ads system-wide. There are many hosts file around internet that can block Ads, Trackers, etc.
   2. If you are using [**Netguard**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.faircode.netguard&amp;hl=en_IN)**,** from above, there is a github version of it that supports ad-blocking as well ([https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md](https://github.com/M66B/NetGuard/blob/master/ADBLOCKING.md))
   3. If you prefer to do this without VPN, devices above Android-9 supports Private DNS in settings. (Having [dns.adguard.com](https://dns.adguard.com) as your private DNS will block ads system-wide)


4. **Performance and battery:**
   1. Frequently clearing an app from Recents menu will make it load again and consume more battery.
   2. Automation apps like Bixby Routines / Tasker can be used to enhance battery life / performance, like
      1. Turn off Mobile Data / Location when you're connected to Home Wifi network.
      2. Turn off Data-Sync when phone is not charging.
      3. Turn on Battery saver at night.
      4. Turn on Locations only when you open an app that needs it (like Google maps, Uber, etc.)
   3. Turning off background Wifi Scanning, Automatically download software updates can improve Battery life.
   4. Turn off Digital Wellbeing by removing it from Usage Data Access, if you're not using it.
   5. Don't use aggressive battery savers, they would cause more drain. Android's default Doze is good enough IMO.
   6. Prefer Dark / Black themes especially when you have OLED displays.
   7. Disable Fast charging whenever you can.
   8. Keep your battery within 80% - 20% to prolong battery life.


5. **Other tips:**
   1. Use [**Youtube Vanced**](https://vanced.app/) instead of default youtube app. This blocks all ads and allows Background playback, PiP mode and a cool AMOLED black theme.
   2. [**Google Opinion Rewards**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.paidtasks&amp;hl=en_IN) is a neat way to earn Google Play credits that can be used for play store purchases.
   3. If you have a Samsung phone, check out GoodLock suite of apps. They are made by Samsung and offer crazy levels of customization. Also Hex installer is cool if you're into customization.
   4. Reducing animation scale in Developer options will make your phone feel more responsive if you have older phones.
   5. If you don't use Google assistant, disable Microphone access to google app and remove it from Device Assistant app from Settings-&gt;App-&gt;Default Apps.
   6. Using [**Your phone**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.appmanager&amp;hl=en_IN) for Windows or [**KDE Connect**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.kdeconnect_tp&amp;hl=en_IN) for Linux can make things seamless between Phone and PC.
   7. If your phone has NFC, it can be used to automate lot of things by tapping on NFC tags like Turning on WiFi when you enter home, Unlock your PC by having a Tag near it, Having a bed time routine with a Tag on your bed, etc.  Check out [**NFC Tools**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc&amp;hl=en_IN) for more. 
   8. [**Hermit**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chimbori.hermitcrab&amp;hl=en_IN) can replace many apps like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon with their web versions.
   9. [**Firefox Send**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mozilla.firefoxsend&amp;hl=en_IN) can be used to send files &lt; 2GB to anyone through a link.
   10. Replace chrome with [**Kiwi browser**](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kiwibrowser.browser&amp;hl=en_IN) or Firefox, they are open-source and support extensions.
   11. Install and enable ADB on your PC and always allow debugging for your phone from your PC. This will come in handy when your display is broken, by controlling screen with scrcpy.
   12. If you have a Snapdragon CPU, there will be a modded version of Google's camera for your phone. It would improve picture quality drastically with Google's HDR+ processing. You can check xda-developers.com for GCam for your device.
   13. snapdrop.net can be used to share files to any device within your network. Just enter the URL in you browser and it'll work.


PS - Be careful when uninstalling system apps. Use a recommended debloat list for your device if you're not sure.

I will be adding more tips here. Suggestions are welcome.
